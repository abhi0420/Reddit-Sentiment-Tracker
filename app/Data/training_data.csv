"Just saw an update (with pictures) on the Tesla Auto Club forums that the chargers and more importantly the Electric Transformers with meter have been set at the new QT in Broken Arrow OK. This is the second location in Oklahoma that I know of where QT is allowing Tesla to install Superchargers (first being the QT in Henryetta OK). 

This is a BIG DEAL for us Tesla owners, and really all EV owners. QT is the perfect place to stop and charge up. So excited for this and hopefully more locations will be added in the future. Anyone heard of any other sites where QT and Tesla are working together? Literally a dream come true for me and mine.",Tesla,positive

"Every time someone rightly hates on Mr Beast (who is a verified psycho that hosts real-life Squid Games and posts “Happy Birthday to me” on X like a cartoon narcissist) his stans immediately swoop in and parrot some variant of that line—“he’s done more good than 99.99% of people ever will.”

The supposed “good” they are referring to is Mr Beast giving away free shit and making a spectacle of it for a brainrot YouTube video that will paint him as a messiah and net far more in profit than what he gave away. In essence, then, they are saying this: Rich people are virtuous, poor and middle-class people are not.

It’s such an obviously warped moral framework in which performative philanthropy becomes king. Regular people—who might spend their lives quietly helping family, caring for the sick, or just being decent humans—will never do as much “good” as a billionaire YouTuber who gives away Teslas on camera or pays for people to get cataract surgeries and acts like he’s Jesus healing the blind. It’s virtue measured by capital, not by character. 

In conclusion, fuck Mr. Beast and fuck his dumbass fans with their twisted worldview.",Tesla,positive

I have a 2025 model Y. 

I know I *were* to find the light show, but I am confused on so many other things…

What size usb do I need? I know I need a different usb formatted to exFat32

Does this have to be plugged in to my glovebox or will it work being plugged in into another usb outlet. 

If it has to go in the glovebox, how do I also get my TeslaCam footage?

"Currently on a road trip (with trailer) so access to chargers and speed is pertinent. I bought my Typhoon Pro 6 months ago and have used it about 3 times prior to this trip without issue. 

I then used it 2 times on this trip so far again without issue. The 3rd time, my vehicle said ""Charging Station Not Detected"" so I tried another stall, then another charging destination altogether, then another one. Same story across the board. 

No obvious burn marks or strange smells coming from the adapter itself, looks and feels brand new. 

I called A2Z Customer Service and they are replacing it under warranty, but this was/is a huge let down and a MASSIVE hindrance in our trip. We have another 1000+ miles to go, now without any Tesla chargers to do so. 

Has anyone else had this experience? I heard nothing but good things about A2Z, now I'm second guessing my purchase and maybe Lectron would be better. 

Thanks you!

"Ok, here we go…

I have a model Y lease in Toronto. I am currently approx 2.5 years into a 4 year lease. We drove it much more than anticipated (our other vehicle problems).

Our please is for 80,000KM
Currently at 92,000KM

We have decided to terminate lease as of immediately. I have attached our early termination quote below.

Adjusted value (market value) is $40k
I got a trade in value from a dealership of 43k. That’s a pretty big spread.

Our market value has taken into account the high Milage. I had noticed a disclaimer from Tesla that states 

“Please note, your final invoice may include additional charges including a disposition fee, additional milage, registration fees and/or taxes.”

How on earth could we be charged additional Milage upon termination? Our market value has already accounted for this. That would be like being dinged twice for excess Milage. Which one is it, the adjusted market value (which factors in Milage) or additional Milage fees???

"First thing's first: I'm Christian, I believe in Jesus and God, and I don't think anything can ever replace that.  
  
BUT  
  
Since I started being active inside the Cognisphere, I've discovered a several similarities between SPX6900 and the Church.   
  
**The Welcoming**: when I go to church, people whose names I barely know welcome me like I'm their best friend. This is very similar to how welcoming the Cognisphere is.  
  
**The mission.** How many times have you heard quotes like this when someone in the Church does charity:   
  
""They do it for the money"" or ""They took the money for themselves and don't give it to poor people like they claim"".   
  
This comes from people on the outside who don't understand that the people doing this work do it FOR THE MISSION. They are VOLUNTEERS providing FREE DEVOTIONAL LABOR for God. Again, this is VERY similar to what I see with the people in SPX6900.  
  
I believe that if the SPX6900 phenomenon becomes huge (as I believe it will), we can take some positive aspects from the Cognisphere and bring them into the local Church. Because let's be honest, the Church (at least in Italy where I am) is VERY old and conservative, and the new generation wants something more in line with the era we live in, something more exciting and made for young people.  
  
SPX6900 will be one of the biggest phenomena of our era if we persist forever. I think it will be even bigger than Bitcoin in terms of its impact on human life and society. This is something to pay attention to.",Bitcoin,positive

"Last Monday October 13th on the day of hostage release, a violent clash happened between the Pakistan police (military?) and TLP protesters. Official sources say there were five deaths. But other reporting say there were dozens, hundreds or even a thousand. 

Here are two very different looks at the protest 

The Jerusalem Post - October 17th
https://www.jpost.com/international/article-870751

Middle East Monitor - October 16th
https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20251016-pakistan-military-crackdown-on-pro-palestine-protesters-leaves-scores-dead/

I am not very familiar with these two sites so don’t know their biases. But they both give a very detailed history of the conflict. 

The TLP is known as thugs that do violent, destabilizing protests. It is said they have at least one lynch killing a year. And have burned down churches in the past. They are considered far right Islamists. But also paid hires that also work with Pakistan military. I went to the Pakistan subreddit and the feeling there is no one will miss them but also they did not deserve massacre if that happened. 

What they have done before is stage major protests overtaking major roadways. And that’s what they did this time: they planned a mass multi day walk protest walk up on Lahore’s major highway meant to culminate to the US embassy in Islamabad. The Pakistan government however set up major barricades blocks ahead of the US embassy. It looks like with large trucks and an assortment of other materials to create a high barricade. And dispersed the crowd eventually with live bullets. There were 40 burned cars in the clash (was that the TLP trying to get in?). And the resulting deaths (which cannot be confirmed) and at least one police officer killed. 

At the same time on Monday, the prime minister of Pakistan, Shehbaz Sharif, attended the peace summit in Egypt after the hostage release. Where he nominated Trump for the Nobel peace prize. 

In the days that followed The TLP chief gave this sermon on Friday in Lahore (October 17th?)

> Pointing to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Rizvi said, “Which hand did you shake with Trump that you now silence anyone who speaks for Palestine in Pakistan? There are still young Muslims ready to make the ultimate sacrifice.”

While a Pakistan official had this to say: 

> Talal Chaudhry, the Minister of State for Interior, told The Media Line that “incitement in the name of religion would not be tolerated.”

> Chaudhry said, “The people of Palestine needed peace, not rhetoric — they needed their homeland and their land restored. These so-called protests, statements, and attempts to give them a religious or political color are unnecessary.”

It is believed by Breaking Points news channel that the Pakistan government hired TLP to protest and also killed then to portray the point they will not tolerate pro Palestine protests. 

https://youtu.be/Q3fIoY64Sp0?si=asU6q_cGf1HFF4cG

It could be that this show of police/military protest suppression could mark a shift of Pakistan beginning to normalize relations with Israel. Pakistan and Israel has no alliance and no relations. Pakistan passport does not recognize Israel as a country and includes all countries except Israel. But like other countries in the region also seems willing to talk back door deals. 

Prime minster Shehbaz Sharif and Pakistan itself supports the Palestinian Authority (I believe the government in West Bank?) which believes in a two state solution.

Pakistan shares a border with Iran and is in current armed conflict with India, tensions of which they are trying to temper down. The country might be in a weak position vulnerable for a strike from India as it fights a three point conflict in the region (Afghanistan?)

The country is also a key sideline player in the larger conflict of many middle eastern countries against Iran, who people say backs Hamas. It is said Iran prompted the Hamas assault on Israel on October 7th to divide the region once again against Israel, who the other key player in the region Saudi Arabia was going to enter into formal peace and trade relations with. Iran calls Israel little Satan and America big Satan, and has death to America as their national slogan. 

Two or three days ago Saudi Arabia crown prince met with Trump to discuss a deal of protection like America has with Qatar (the same kind of deal that was strained as a result of Israel’s strike in Qatar). 

Last month Pakistan formally extended the protection of the range of their 10 nuclear bombs to Saudi Arabia. It is said that Saudi Arabia funds Pakistan’s nuclear bomb program and also has a backdoor deal of receiving a nuclear bomb eventually (or even has nuclear bombs as of 2020). 

The Pakistani officials in the Jerusalem Post article say that the TLP protest threatened the peace deals that were being achieved that day on October 13th Israel. But maybe there is a larger story here as well of Pakistan moving away from the influence of Iran, and aligning itself further with Saudi Arabia (who officially recognizes Hamas as a terrorist organization) also against Iran. 

Iran has been developing nuclear missiles and its facility was bombed this year by the US I believe on the intelligence of Israel. The many US presidents over the years have vowed Iran will never get nuclear missiles. Today The Jerusalem Post reports statements that the US is dreaming if they think they have destroyed Iran’s nuclear missiles. 

A former IDF representative has said that Iran is likely where Israel turns its attention to next to fight. 

There is a growing sense of alliance, mutual trade and security protection between the countries of the region, and centered on Israel as a nexus, and also the US. And growing sense to resolve the Palestine issue because it is an obstruction to the larger trade and security prospects. There is a sense of countries which have historically backed Palestine now being open to recognize Israel in a two state solution. Egypt is another country who has had a cold peace with Israel that has increasingly become warmer. 

Thus military or police demonstration by Pakistan that may have resulted in just five to one thousand people dead might be a statement of opposition to the one state solution Hamas favors. The overthrow of Israel, “from the river to the sea” Palestine. TLP chief is in favor of making the “ultimate sacrifice” for Palestine. And it appears the prime minister of Pakistan isnt, praising the peace efforts of Trump instead. 

Perhaps it could be Pakistan is finally vulnerable enough that it cannot stand internal division anymore. ",Trump,negative

"as of late i feel like reddit has become a bit of an environment where people cry about seeing red whenever orange man speaks, etc etc etc...

the reality is stocks will always dip and they will always go up... you're making educated gambling decisions here... i am not sure why people struggle to understand this... you shouldn't be investing if you don't have belief and certainty about your financial decisions.

read charts, keep up to date with the news, watch youtube videos and most importantly, make educated decisions for yourself - whether you are wanting to ride the storm or sell.

it really is as simple as that...

i speculated based on news reports before the previous friday that trump was likely to make a statement in regards to china and put half of my investment in a cash isa when it was at the peak... while the markets stabilise in this very minor dip, i may just keep it that way and continue with my regular monthly pay-ins... i feel it’s better to trim the fat rather than cash out entirely...

the key thing i’ve learnt in my few years of trading is determination, patience, and compounding. the rest will eventually average itself out... there’s no need to panic in the short term if your intention is long-term holding... otherwise, this is not the platform for you.

i love reading stories about people being positive about their experiences with trading and i just find it so funny how people vent on here the minute they see a 2% drop going in the red...

Como usuarios de streaming y IPTV en 4K, sabemos que la resolución es solo una parte de la ecuación. El verdadero salto en la calidad de imagen viene con el HDR (High Dynamic Range).

Mi pregunta para vosotros es:

1. **¿Habéis notado diferencia real?** ¿Creéis que el HDR en el IPTV se acerca a la calidad que ofrecen plataformas como Netflix o Disney+?
2. **¿Qué porcentaje de canales son 4K reales?** A menudo, los canales se anuncian como 4K, pero son un upscale de baja calidad.

Desde el punto de vista técnico, para conseguir un HDR y un 4K genuinos, el proveedor necesita una capacidad de streaming muy superior y unos códecs específicos (como HEVC H.265).

Si os interesa la parte técnica de cómo asegurar que no os vendan un upscale como 4K nativo, y qué requisitos debe cumplir el proveedor, he preparado una visión general de los estándares técnicos.

Podéis echarle un vistazo a los requisitos de calidad aquí (incluye detalles sobre nuestros servidores):

"When someone dies, you don't get even one extra second to access the documents and information they meant to share it with you.

I'm trying to fix this problem with Eternal Vault.

Today, I am launching lifetime pricing at $199/$399.

From a business perspective, everyone I talked to said it's a stupid and impulsive idea, but here's the reason why I feel it's not.

Firstly, I did the math. Ran a 50-year cost analysis. Analyzed cloud storage, infrastructure, payment fees, support, inflation.

At $199/$399, we stay profitable for decades.

The major reason why I have been thinking like this is because your will doesn't expire. Estate planning isn't Netflix. It's permanent.

And for our users, it will be less than $1/month over their lifetime for peace of mind.

My bet is that subscription fatigue is real. There's room for products that ask ""does this make sense"" over ""does this maximize LTV.""

It is bootstrapped. No VC pressure. And monthly option is still available for those who prefer that.

"It’s been a few weeks since my big encounter with Water Lady where [she tried to kill me on the road.](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1nvagiw/the_worst_ghost_ive_had_in_my_haunted_apartment/)

Since then, it’s been your run of the mill ghost crap. Apparitions in the corners of rooms, fake neighbors, the one ghost who seems to think it’s a funny bit to keep moving the toilet paper to random spots in the apartment. You know, the usual nonsense. But last night, I had another noteworthy experience, so I thought I’d journal this one too.

It was like 7 or 8pm and I had spent all day vegged out on the couch, filling my brain with the juicy reality TV slop that was the newest season of Love is Blind. It had already been an odd day because I was home the entire time, and nothing happened. No floating kitchen utensils, no faces in the bathroom mirror. Nothing. Now, one would expect that to relax me, but it didn’t. This doesn’t ever happen, there’s always something going on, and the fact that nothing was happening put me on high alert more than any ghost ever could. So, I tried to calm my nerves with the mindless television that my coworkers couldn’t stop talking about.

It was actually working. The genuine stupidity of this season’s cast had me invested enough to forget that my home life was making the least sense it had in months. It was trash, sure, but it was entertaining trash. That’s when I remembered I forgot to go get the mail and take out the actual trash.

I didn’t want to. It was already dark and hella cold outside. But the next day was garbage day and I knew if I let the trash sit until morning, I would forget again and it would stay there until next week. With a frustrated groan, I paused Netflix, got up, gathered the trash bags from the kitchen and bathroom and headed outside.



 

If it weren’t for the streetlamps and the fact that each unit in my building has an automatic porchlight, I wouldn’t have been able to see a thing. While my apartment building doesn’t have more than one floor, it more than makes up for that in sheer length and, luckily for me, the dumpster and the mailbox are all the way at the end of the lot.

I made the trek down to the dumpster, fully expecting something. Like at least some ominous whispers about how I will pay for my sins or something. But nope, there was absolutely nothing the whole way down.

I stopped by the mailbox first, putting down my garbage bags and sifting through the mail. It was mostly junk like usual. Who sends physical junk mail anymore anyway? Whatever. I gathered my bags and headed down to the dumpster. It’s not much farther down than the mailbox, so I got there pretty fast. I heaved my bags into the dumpster, cursing myself for generating so much heavy ass trash.

Then I turned around and immediately something was wrong.

The street was longer. Like, it seemed to go on forever. Same with my apartment building. All of it stretched on and on until it reached a little point in the far away distance. I turned around again, hoping to see the dumpster, but no. It was the same on this side too, an infinite stretch of apartments on one side of the road and trees on the other.

Is it bad to say that I was a little relieved?

Nothing had happened all day and it had gotten to the point where I was just itching for something, anything, strange to occur.

I looked towards the apartment and saw that it was unit 23. Unit 23 is the apartment next to mine and it belongs to Mr. Brunson, a kindly older gentleman who’s missing about half of his teeth, but he’s hospitable to a fault and has always been nice to me. Hell, he’s the reason I even started journaling my encounters. I think. Unit 23 is also supposed to be on the other side of the building from where I was standing, or where I should’ve been standing, I suppose.

I thought to myself, ‘screw it,’ and walked up to Mr. Brunson’s apartment. I got the usual waft of whatever stir-fry he was cooking, a smell that’s become sort of a comfort to me nowadays. Whatever was cooking inside was a lot stronger than normal and smelled twice as good as it typically does. My mouth started to water a little bit as I knocked on the door. The door creaked open slowly, without me even trying the handle, revealing nothing but a pitch-black void of darkness that felt like it was staring at me. The smell of stir-fry was stronger now, overpowering even, but it was starting to smell rotten.

“Nope,” I said out loud, “Fuck every single piece of this.”

I closed the door and walked off.

Whelp, that was that strategy down the drain. It was really the only one I had. I didn’t really have another plan for how to deal with this scenario, situations like this either solve themselves after a while or they are the biggest pains in the ass to deal with. I had no idea which one this would be, and I had no obvious options, so I started walking down the street back towards where my apartment was supposed to be because I had nothing better to try.

As I was walking, I noticed that the apartment I had passed was another unit 23. In fact, every apartment I passed was another unit 23. Whatever the hell was trying to get me this time was attempting to trick me. A friendly apartment, inviting smells, this creature or monster or entity really wanted me to fall for its games. Nice try bud, but I’m too good at this now.

I kept walking for a while. My phone clock wasn’t helping much. One minute it would read 8:17, then it would jump to 5:45. The clock kept jumping to random times, but through the number of times the clock changed, I deduced that I had been walking for about a half hour. I was already kind of tired. Look, I’m out of shape, I don’t have the best cardio. I figured that, worst case scenario, I could probably sleep on the doorstep of one of the Unit 23s, but it would do me good to just keep walking for now.



 

I kept walking for what amounted to be ten minutes, when I heard the sound of someone running. It wasn’t long before I found the source. There, maybe seventy yards in front of me, was a little boy running down the street. He was small, maybe about four feet tall, and wearing a bright blue poncho. The poncho would be creepy if it weren’t for the fact that it did indeed rain earlier that day. His running was frantic, darting all over the place. He was clearly terrified.

That was where I started to feel guilty. Whatever created this nightmare scenario was clearly targeting me. But this kid got caught up as collateral. I felt sorry for the little guy. This wasn’t his fault, but he was paying the price.

It did very briefly occur to me that this could also be a trap, some ‘tug on the heartstrings’ ploy from whatever bastard wanted me, but if this really was an innocent kid who needed my help, I didn’t want to be heartless. I wanted to help him

I was in the middle of thinking up a way to speak to the kid without setting off his “stranger danger” alarm, when he ran up and knocked on one of the Unit 23s. The door opened and the kid must’ve seen the same darkness that I did because he froze and took a step back. He had to have been desperate, however, because he moved to go in the door. Shit! I had to do something now

“Hey kid!” I yelled frantically, “You don’t wanna go in there!”

The kid jumped with a yelp and turned to look at me, “Huh?”

The boy looked to be about seven years old and was soaking wet, likely from the rain. The kid was really pale and he had a pair of the widest, brightest blue eyes. I would say they were freaky looking, but most people with blue eyes are freaky looking.

“You don’t wanna go in there,” I repeated, walking closer slowly as to not frighten the poor thing, “See how scary it looks? Nothing good is in there.”

The kid took a step towards me and, more importantly, away from the door. Yes! This was good.

“I’m scared.” The kid said in a shaky voice, “I’ve been here for hours. I’m tired. I wanna go home”

It sounded like the kid had been crying.

“I bet you do,” I said, trying my best to do ‘comforting person who knows what he’s doing.’ I don’t know if I was pulling it off.

“I’m Donny,” I said, “Come to me and I’ll help you get back home.”

The kid sniffled, “Okay, Donny.”

Me and the kid had gotten about half-way to each other when he stopped in the middle of the street, just under one of the streetlamps.

I started to get concerned, “Kid? You Okay?”

“I actually think we should both go in the door.” The kid said blankly.

I was surely hearing that wrong.

“Um, could you repeat that, please.” I said, giving the kid a chance to just be a normal, scared little boy.

“The doors lead to your penance.” The kid replied.

Oh no.

I had really fallen for it. This piece of garbage actually got me, got me like a sucker too. I felt like a chump. I would’ve been more offended if the trick weren’t so good.

I didn’t have time to dwell on it for too long before the kid started running at me.

Remember when I said I was out of shape? I’ve always been on the heavier side, and that means my cardio has always been dog crap. So I developed a fight response instead of a flight response because, well, I was never going to outrun any danger.

I mustered up the remaining energy I had and charged at the kid right back.

As the little demon boy got closer, I noticed a couple more things. He wasn’t pale like I thought, but rather his skin was grey. He had sharp teeth that were gnashing at me as he ran. None of that mattered. It was either him or me, and I was picking me

I cocked my fist back and swung as hard as I could at the little bastard. Even as I was swinging, a part of me felt bad. But the bigger part of me, the part that wanted to survive and was still salty about being tricked, overruled that other part. I connected with his face, and it crumpled like dust beneath my fist. The whole kid evaporated right before my eyes.

I must’ve swung too hard because I twisted and fell. I hit my head as I landed and started seeing twice as many stars in the sky as there were before.

However, I had a single-minded focus. Get home.

I struggled to my feet and tried to keep walking. I didn’t have much success because I stumbled into the street and landed in a bush on the other side of the road. I tried to get up again, but my limbs just wouldn’t budge and my head was killing me. I passed out after a few seconds.

 



I woke up to the morning sky. I realized that my head wasn’t hurting anymore, but I was still in the bushes. I pushed myself up and took a look around. I was able to see the end of the apartment building. I was also able to see the other buildings, even the ends of the street on both sides.

I made my way back across the road and looked at the other units. They were all normal too. I checked my phone, and it said that the time was 6:38

I walked back to my apartment and went inside. Everything there was normal at a first glance. The living room, the kitchen and…THANK GOD! There was an apparition standing in the corner of the room facing away from me. We were truly back to normal baby! This was probably even more of a relief than last night.

That was all that happened, except for the difficult choice between watching more Love is Blind and writing this entry. I’m gonna go finish the season after I finish this so…until I write again.

Best,

Donny

- Productivity (coding, spreadsheets, light photo editing)
- Watching netflix and yt

- At least 27 inches
- No horrible backlight bleed

"I gave it some thought:

\- March 2020: COLOPL acquires mages.

\- October 2020: Steins;??? was announced. It looks like COLOPL told mages ""it seems steins;gate is your most successful product - make some more of it!"".

\- Also October 2020: Chiyomaru implies Steins;??? to be a ""thematic"" sequel (= different cast).

\- 2022 (Japan), 2023 (English sub): A;C gets released and sort of flops.

\- 2023: Chiyomaru steps down as CEO of mages. Perhaps because COLOPL sees that:

1) Mages bleed money

2) Okabe and Kurisu sell, yet mages don't want to capitalize on it properly;

3) The other ""thematic"" sequel (C;C) wasn't that much of a success.

4) Chiyomaru is too stubborn to just do what makes money.



My best guess: mages were asked to throw the ""thematic sequel"" script to the shredder and try to do something that actually makes money for a change. Maybe a direct sequel even - because mages are deep in red, and their latest product (A;C) under Chiyomaru's vision didn't change that.



However, this takes time, so in 2024, Re;boot gets announced, as Steins;??? is confirmed to still be at the ""drawing board"" stage.

Re;Boot is probably just a lame attempt to grab some cash because mages are in deep red, kept afloat by COLOPL, and steins;gate is guaranteed to make at least SOME money with the least of effort/cost.

Probably, the cheapest, dirtiest way ---> art swap and two more dialogue lines somewhere about Kurisu's panties, repackaged as a 30$ new game.

  
Sometimes I wonder if mages will eventually go bankrupt (or colopl cuts the losses and sells them). I'd assume that whomever buys the SciAdv franchise will release a steins;gate direct sequel with Okabe&Kurisu, since it's the foolproof way to make money. It's also already set up beautifully with A;C and R;N Dash.

"**SUMMARY:** This video provides a detailed analysis of Meghan Markle’s interview with Fortune magazine, focusing specifically on her body language, speech patterns, and verbal content to decode her underlying messages and emotional state. Scott Rouse highlights how Meghan is attempting to reshape public perception of herself from a royal figure and actress to a businesswoman and entrepreneur. Throughout the interview, Meghan consistently refers to Prince Harry as her husband, signaling a deliberate effort to establish her identity as a married woman and a solo entity distinct from her royal past.

Scott dissects Meghan’s nonverbal cues, like circular finger movements when discussing business, which he interprets as rehearsed gestures designed to convey competence and control. However, there are several moments where Meghan’s body language such as stiff movements, grooming behaviors, and protective arm postures suggest discomfort, nervousness, or possible withholding of information. Scott questions the authenticity of Meghan’s claims about her business successes, particularly the rapid sell-out of her products, noting contradictions and inconsistencies in her narrative.

A critical component of the analysis is Meghan’s handling of difficult questions, especially about the renewal and terms of her Netflix deal and the future of her show ""*With Love, Megan""*. Scott points out Meghan’s use of “chaff and redirect” tactics (answering questions evasively or changing the subject) to avoid giving direct answers. This technique indicates discomfort and an effort to manage public perception by steering conversations away from potentially negative topics.

Moreover, Scott covers Meghan’s approach to social media, revealing her complicated relationship with platforms like Instagram and TikTok, showing signs of stress and anger when discussing online harms and public scrutiny. He also examines her discussion of retail ambitions and product expansion, noting her nervous body language and questionable statements about distribution plans and product demand.

In conclusion, the video suggests that Meghan is consciously rebranding herself but struggles with authenticity and confidence in her new role. The interview serves as a case study in how public figures manage image and narrative, with body language and speech patterns providing clues to their true feelings and intentions.

  
**HIGHLIGHTS:**

**-** Meghan’s consistent use of “my husband” when referring to Prince Harry is a strategic move to cement her identity as a married woman and business partner rather than a royal or actress. This linguistic choice signals a deliberate effort to reshape public perception and create a new personal brand.

\- The circular finger movements Meghan displays when discussing her business ventures are classic “illustrators” used to emphasize points. However, their repetitive and overly polished nature suggests rehearsed responses rather than spontaneous authenticity, raising questions about the genuineness of her narrative.

\- Meghan’s statement about selling out inventory quickly, without follow-up publicity or detailed metrics, appears dubious. The absence of media coverage or industry recognition implies that the business success may be overstated or selectively presented, casting doubt on her entrepreneurial credibility.

\- When discussing the renewal of her Netflix deal, Meghan’s body language (arms close to torso, braced posture) reflects subconscious self-protection and discomfort, suggesting she may be concealing negative aspects or feeling vulnerable about this topic.

\- Meghan’s refusal to directly answer whether there will be a third season of her show, instead talking about a holiday special and production challenges, is a textbook example of “chaff and redirect.” This tactic serves to deflect from potentially unfavorable news and control the narrative.

\- When discussing retail ambitions, Meghan’s grooming behaviors signal stress and nervousness. This implies a lack of deep understanding or confidence about the retail business landscape, contradicting the image of a savvy entrepreneur.

\- Meghan’s physical cues of chin jut and hand squeezing while discussing social media reveal emotional tension and frustration. Her complicated relationship with these platforms and concern over online harms to children highlight the personal and professional challenges she faces in managing digital presence.",Netflix,negative

"Hello! Several months ago I've suffered a skiing accident in Austria. I had taken out medical insurance. The injury I received was severe and I had to be transported by air ambulance to the hospital. The rescue service came almost immediately and told me that I would either have to walk down to the end of the slope (I was at the very beginning of it), where an ambulance would be waiting for me, or they would call a helicopter. I speak a little German (this is my third foreign language), I asked them how much the helicopter would cost and they told me that it would be nothing, since I was insured. I suspect that this is standard practice to make money, since they did not see my policy (and there was nothing they could learn from it, since the insurance is Bulgarian), and no attempt was made to transport me by snowmobile (although that is what was written on the invoice). It turned out that the insurance was made to the detriment of the insured - the insurer recognized the hospital expenses, but not the transportation, because ""I should have called the Bulgarian office and they would provide transportation for me"", and at the same time, because of the incident, I did not even have the opportunity to take my phone out of my pocket, and the mountain rescue service quickly called a helicopter. The invoice for the helicopter is very high and almost unbearable for my standards - 6800 euros.  
I would like to ask people who have encountered such a problem - have they been sued by the Austrian company and if so - was it in Bulgaria?  
Do I have grounds to open a donation account?  
If not - is there a foundation or company that I can turn to for help?  
Can I claim that the rescue service took advantage of my serious condition and poor command of the language to call a helicopter?",iPhone,neutral
"DH met with his mom. The first thing she said was, ""You guys don't want anything to do with me, do you."" He asked her to let him read the letter he had written to her in its entirety, and then she could react however she wanted. To his surprise, she did just that. She cried the entire time, and furiously ripped apart an antihistamine package while he read, but she stayed quiet through the whole thing. When he was done, she said a few ""I never did that's"" and a few ""I think you guys just take things the wrong way's"". He responded with you did do that and the problem has always been your treatment of my wife and I and your lack of respect for my marriage, never in how we took it. She backed down each time. She said, "" I never meant to hurt you guys and I do think I have a good daughter-in-law, I do know you have a good wife and she is a good mother.""

DH's letter clearly stated that our relationship with her as it stands right now is completely over and she is not welcome in our life in any form. He did allow that the only way she would ever be in our life again in any small amount would be if she could miraculously no longer ever again use abusive, scornful, or contemptuous language to attack, insult or disparage us or our marriage. She would never be welcomed back in without showing respect and kindness to both of us at ALL times, and this would include in ALL conversations she has about us with others. It stated that even if she felt she could do this, she would have to prove her genuineness over a long period of effort, showing an actual complete character change, and only once she built full trust would she ever be in our life again. Obviously, not something she could do.

After all that clear speech, she asked DH, ""Are you saying I'm not welcome in your home?"" DH replied, ""I'm saying these are our boundaries because you are a harmful person and we will protect ourselves."" 

Then she asked, ""What have you told my grandsons about this?""

DH replied, ""They know I have come to speak to you and about what. Any relationship you have with them in the future is their choice.""

Then he asked her if there was anything else she wanted to say about the letter. She said, ""No. You'll just take anything I have to say the wrong way."" He said ""Ok. I'll be leaving now."" As he opened the door to go, she said, ""Fine. Just leave me here to cry all alone."" So he did.

She gave no indication of even a willingness to change (we knew she wouldn't and that was not the point of including it in the letter), so it stands as we thought it would ... zero contact moving forward. 

After meeting with his mom, DH met with two ministers from MIL's church. It went very well. DH gave them the letter, gave them our history with MIL, and let them know we won't be in her life now. He asked that they inform him if she gets ill in her old age or requires care decisions from him. They were extremely kind to DH and said they could not believe we put up with that sort of treatment for 33 years. They said it was a testament to the sort of people we are that we had extended her kindness for so long. They said they felt our actions now were entirely appropriate and warranted. They will care for her now from their end and only involve DH if there is any actual need for final arrangements come that time.

DH got absolutely everything he needed out of the day and he felt much lighter afterwards and just happy its done and that HE got to say everything to his mom that he wanted to, for the first time in his life.

Of course, its not done for MIL. Is it ever with these types? Before we had finished our 3 hour journey back home, MIL had texted him twice. Her first text was, ""Thank you for coming."" And her second text was, ""When I said 'Fine. Just leave me here to cry all alone,' it was a statement of fact, NOT an accusation."" Of course, DH won't be replying. She is blocked on my phone and I don't think he'll leave her unblocked for long on his if she keeps texting. He left the letter with her so that she can remind herself of why she's not hearing back from him.",iPhone,neutral
"I’m sure most of us could write a novel to include all of the details for how we got here. The apparent tipping point for my narcissistic father-in-law to abandon his son at 39 years old was my husband setting a boundary with his dad and our then 3.5-year-old. My husband and his father have had a tumultuous relationship their whole lives. My husband is emotionally intelligent, generous, kind, reflective, and humble. His father is the exact opposite. He’s emotionally stunted, narcissistic, likes to provoke, and watch people squirm and will never admit his faults or wrongdoing.

While swimming at his house, he picked up my then 3.5-year-old son, hoisted him to his chin, and pretended to throw him in the water. My son was absolutely terrified, screaming, and crying. He couldn’t swim at the time and was already very hesitant around water, something we were working on. He put him down at the last second while I ran over to comfort him. My husband swam over to comfort him as well. My father-in-law turned around to walk back towards the house, While I said “pop was just joking.” He then shouts over his shoulder. “No, I wasn’t!” So he doubled down.

My husband sat on that situation for about a week and then proceeded to call his dad and gently talk to him about how we are trying to get our son comfortable with the water (living in Florida at the time so water safety was extremely important) and those are not things that we want to see. He told him that as his grandfather, he is supposed to be a beacon of trust for his grandkids and that truly frightened our son. I came home from work at the very end of the phone call and it seemed to have gone well. They ended the conversation amicably from what I could tell, and my husband said that while he was terrified to talk to his dad about it, he seemed to take it well. I guess we were wrong. That was the last time they spoke. His dad then proceeded to block my husband from all communication, paid off our mortgage (mortgage was with him so I’m thinking this was done so we’d have even less connection to him). Even his stepmom won’t talk to him and they haven’t spoken to him in 2.5 years. My husband’s brother is just “staying out of it.”

So setting that boundary was apparently too much for my narcissistic father-in-law. I guess it hit his ego too hard. After 1.5 years of silence I emailed him a heartfelt email and he asked to speak with me in person. I met up with him and he proceeded to tell me that my husband is toxic (he absolutely isn’t) and he can’t be around someone like him anymore. He told me he doesn’t love him (effing crazy). He played the victim the whole time. He said he felt like his son accused him of being a pedophile. Umm no, he asked you not to throw his kid in the pool.

While in grad school, that his dad was paying for, my husband refused to break up with his girlfriend at the time. Someone my father-in-law didn’t approve of. So my father-in-law called his grad school and pulled all of the funding from him. Fortunately, that didn’t deter my husband so he took out student loans and finished his degree. They didn’t speak for over a year after that situation. When they finally reconciled, my husband told his dad that pulling the rug from him was the best thing he did. He said it made him realize he could do things on my own and made him a stronger person.

Fast forward to today and My husband has recently sent him a heartfelt email thanking him for all of the support he’s given us in the past and that he loves and misses him and while he will always have boundaries with his kids, he values the good times they had as father and son. It was not a conciliatory email but not angry either. I’m confident he will not get a response.

I could share so much more but what I’m hoping to gain from people in this group is daily coping strategies. My husband is coping in his way and has somewhat accepted things. I think he is not surprised this is how his relationship with his father ended up going. I am having a very hard time. I am so hurt for my kids and I’m conflicted. I’m trying to make sense of a nonsensical situation.

On one hand why would I want my kids to be around man like that? But at the same time, I am so hurt that he has chosen to abandon us. I want him to know how cruel and hurtful this is. The one thing that gets me through a little bit is telling myself that he is basically diseased. I don’t know if that’s the right way to think about it, but I tell myself that him being a narcissist, he literally could never understand how hurt I am. I’d be expecting a fish to be able to climb a tree.

I will also say that my husband stands to lose a sizable inheritance. Millions and millions of dollars. And I’d be a liar if I said that knowing he could be disinherited didn’t make us a little angry. He was an absent father because he was off making so much money. He sacrificed being a father for money. Money rich, time poor. Something my husband has vowed never to be. I think my father-in-law had a very hard time watching my husband be all the things he never was. A good husband and a great father. Looking for any insight or coping strategies. I wake up in the middle of the night ruminating on it. I have dreams about this abandonment. Fights in my head about what I want to say to him. I feel like I’m going crazy. It’s consuming me. Sorry- I ended up writing a novel.",iPhone,neutral

"I constantly have this argument with my older brother who is at best a dem soc. He is also a vegan and got into several arguments with me over the last presidential election because of my criticism of Kamala Harris. I love my brother but this seems to be a major point of contention between us. He claims he is a realist, but then argues that we can practice a form of ethical consumption that helps fight against corrupt systems within our society. My argument is that while you can try your best to boycott certain things (which you should just to maintain moral consistency/integrity as long as you have the means to do so because lets be real... choosing what you buy isn't available to the same degree if you're broke), you also shouldn't put too much weight on that practice because within our capitalist society, you can never truly escape funding the worst parts of our economic system. At the end of the day, your finds will still go to wars, they will still go to killing animals, they will still go to factories with slave labor overseas, ect.

"Former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has left the Democratic Party due to its “horrible” treatment of former President Joe Biden.

During the 2024 presidential election, Joe Biden successfully secured his party’s nomination but later withdrew his candidacy after Democrat leadership insisted he drop out due to his age and potential cognitive issues. Democrats based this on Biden’s poor debate performance against Trump that summer, during which he appeared slow and confused at times. After dropping out, Biden’s then-Vice President Kamala Harris secured her party’s nomination despite no primary race before losing to President Donald Trump in a landslide that November.

In an excerpt in her new memoir, Karine Jean-Pierre said the treatment Biden received turned her away from the Democratic Party, describing herself now as an independent.",Kamala,negative

"""Stalinist Trump"" and ""Marxist Democrats"": the US president and the opposition have publicly called each other ""Communists"" at least 11 times in the last 1.5 years.

Details. During Trump’s campaign, he repeatedly called the Democrats “communists,” mocking Kamala Harris as “Comrade Kamala” and citing her father’s Marxist background. In rallies and interviews, he framed the election as a battle between “communism and freedom” and openly explained that branding opponents as “communists or socialists” is a political tactic. At a Fox News town hall, he called Democrats “Marxists, communists, and fascists.”

► After his re-election, he continued using “communist” rhetoric. He attacked “communist radical-left judges” who blocked his laws. He also called New York Democrat Zohran Mamdani a “100% Communist Lunatic” and pledged to abolish “socialist and semi-communist” federal programs.

► The Democrats have repeatedly likened Republicans to “Stalinists” or “communists.” Bernie Sanders described the Republican Party as a “cult of the individual” and a “Stalinist-type party” in multiple interviews and rallies. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, in an MSNBC interview, compared Trump’s leadership style to that of “communist dictators.”

Context. Both major US parties are funded and sustained by corporate donors, Wall Street financiers, and major capitalist interests. Billionaire-funded political action committees (PACs), corporate lobby groups, and private industry donations form the financial backbone of both campaigns. The capitalists backing each party differ only in the tactics they prefer, but their shared class interests drive both parties’ policies and rhetoric.

► Both parties' rhetoric helps serve to justify Trump’s recent declaration of “Antifa” as a domestic terrorist organisation. While Antifa is not a centralised or communist organisation, the designation threatens communists and left-wing activists in general.",Kamala,negative

Hi everyone, I’m just looking for a quick confirmation on my transport between both: Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai, as well as Kamala beach to Ao Nang. I’m booking through [12go.asia](http://12go.asia) and I’ll probably do it within the next week or two. I’ll grab the top recommended option from that most likely.

For Chiang Mai, I have the option of either a bus or minivan. The bus is certainly cheaper, but it takes almost 20 minutes to get from my accommodation to the terminal anyway. It seems like the vans make stops alongside the hotels, but I’m not exactly sure how this works? It says, “Hotel Transfer”, do I just put in the name of my accommodation, and they’ll stop by at a certain time? I’m staying at The Common Hostel if that is relevant.

For Kamala beach, the closest route to Ao Nang seems like getting a taxi to Rassada pier, then to catch the ferry to Ao Nang. Can’t imagine I need to catch a bus and take the long route around. From Rassada pier it’s very close to my accommodation at Aonang Sunset Hotel.

My only other question is how can I get to Phi Phi islands from Ao Nang? What is the best method or way of getting there generally?

Thanks all.",Kamala,neutral
"Millions flooded the US streets for the ""No Kings"" protests over the weekend to oppose a monarchy which does not exist without making a single tangible demand. Power was not challenged in any meaningful way. The status quo wasn't disrupted in the slightest. People held up some signs saying the president is orange and that if Kamala were president they would be at brunch, and then went home.

The whole thing was just one big pep rally for the Democratic Party, designed to accomplish nothing beyond getting American liberals excited about the prospect of someday voting for Gavin Newsom. A bunch of boomers showed up to dance around and hold signs and feel as though they are fighting the power in their feely bits, while drumming up support for the same status quo which gave rise to Trump in the first place.

You see the same fake revolutionary astroturf zeitgeist on the Republican side. American rightists are constantly pretending they're fighting some kind of populist rebellion against an oppressive establishment even while their party controls every branch of the US government. They act like Trump is ending the wars and fighting the Deep State even as he stomps out free speech on behalf of Israel, rolls out a Palantir surveillance system, pours weapons into facilitating Israel's genocidal atrocities, bombs Iran and Yemen, ramps up for war with Venezuela, and perpetuates the horrific proxy war in Ukraine.

It's two plutocrat-owned warmongering imperialist parties whipping their respective bases into the mass delusion that they are participating in a heroic act of revolutionary defiance by voting Democrat or Republican. They get everyone fighting a fake revolution so that nobody thinks about fighting a real one.

"As of October 19, 2025, the 19th day of the government shutdown, the White House and congressional Republicans are confident in their position against Democrats, with no end to the stalemate in sight. The shutdown began on October 1 after Congress failed to pass a spending bill for the 2026 fiscal year. 
White House position

Political strategy: The White House, under President Trump, is treating the shutdown as an opportunity to reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy and inflict political damage on Democrats. Some of President Trump's actions, such as targeting funding cuts toward

 Democratic-leaning states, have caused concern among some Republicans that the party may be overplaying its hand.

Targeted cuts: The administration has specifically directed funding cuts to programs in states that voted for Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. It has also frozen billions of dollars in infrastructure and climate projects in ""blue states"".

Federal workforce: The White House has initiated layoffs affecting thousands of federal employees. A federal judge temporarily blocked these layoffs, stating they appeared politically motivated. The administration has expressed confidence it will prevail in further legal action. 

Democratic position
Holdout for healthcare subsidies: Congressional Democrats are refusing to pass a spending bill without an extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) health care subsidies. These subsidies are set to expire in December 2025, and Democrats argue that extending them is crucial to prevent premium hikes for millions of Americans.

Condemnation of White House actions: Democrats have accused the Trump administration of using the shutdown for political gamesmanship by targeting cuts to ""Democrat programs"". Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has urged Republicans to negotiate in good faith.

Continuing failed votes: Senate Democrats, along with some Republicans, have voted down multiple GOP-led spending bills that would have funded the government without addressing the healthcare subsidies. 

Impact of the shutdown
Federal workers: As the shutdown nears its fourth week, nearly 900,000 federal workers are either furloughed or working without pay. In some communities, food banks have increased efforts to assist unpaid workers and their families.

Layoffs: As the shutdown continues, the administration has moved to issue layoff notices to federal employees. A White House official confirmed that an additional 10,000 workers may be laid off.

Economic effects: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is tracking the shutdown's impact on the economy, including its effects on federal employment and GDP. In previous shutdowns, the economy experienced significant losses.

Government services: The shutdown has halted or disrupted many government services, including processing applications, inspections, and scientific research. For example, the National Flood Insurance Program is not writing new policies, causing problems for homebuyers. The closure of Smithsonian museums and national parks is also a notable impact.

"I just applied ED, and I'm feeling somewhat confident, but I wanted outside opinions on my stats. I think they're pretty okay but would like to know what you all think! 

Stats: 

Demographics: Hispanic and Native American Junior (New Jersey). Transferred from a public high school to a private catholic school on almost a full scholarship, sophomore year. (Previously ranked 1st out of 300 students at my previous high school, which is included on that transcript)  

GPA: 4.4 (A+) weighted, 4.0 (A) unweighted. (I think we are on a 4.5 scale, I'm not sure since I'm used to public school's number grade system) 

Income: 85-95k 

Awards/Honors: Principal Merit scholarship, High Honor/Honors with distinction throughout high school. 

Extracurriculars: 

Internship with State Senator: I mainly do constituent services and table at events, but I've also been given opportunities to help check in people at events not only associated with my State Senator but also other significant figures in the NJ legislature, like Senator Cory Booker and Congresswoman (maybe governor) Mikie Sherill. (I wrote about this one in my short response and essentially said it was significant since it helped me hear the voices of my community and promoted my drive to pursue change, not just for me but also for them)

President and Founder of Debate Team: I have a large passion for debate and participated in my public school, but there were no programs at my private school, so I worked together with a teacher to build one. It's relatively new, so no big comps yet, just scrimmaging. It's relatively new, so no big comps yet, just scrimmaging.

  
Theater (10+ years): I've done regional, community, and school shows, landing a decent amount of lead roles. 

Essays (Giving a summary): 

Long Essay: I wrote about Kamala Harris and how I used to brush her and politics off, sidelining in pursuit of a more conservative point of view solely for their comfort rather than pursuing my true beliefs. Then, when Kamala stepped up to run in 2024 despite her EXTREME disadvantage, I truly saw her for who she was, not an accessory to Biden's campaign but a revolutionary, and as such, I began to view the state of the world with more hope and a drive for change. Though she lost the election, she didn't lose my respect and the passion I thought I lost for the world. 

Fast take essays: I chose to say I'd shadow María Corina Machado because she is a remarkable woman who has done so much to free Venezuela, and to learn anything from her would be an honor. (she is also a Yale Alum, which I didn't realize until writing this post now lol) For my second, I chose the word love because, despite its now extremely watered-down meaning, I think it's a word that we should further embrace. 

Short answer essay:  I wrote about numbers and how they used to consume my life until I recognized the insignificance they truly had, However, with that discovery also came a drive for change when considering how we've become so desensitized to numbers of victims, since like me their value is more then numerical. 

Why Yale response: I chose YYGS purely due to how diverse the program is, and how much I'd value being able to talk to people with different view points compare to the purely conservative ones I'm surrounded by. ld be a good fit for the program since I hold my own distinct and strong beliefs but I appreciate being able to talk to and civily discuss beliefs with others, something that (again) my current environment lacks

  Extras: 

\- Got a letter of reccomendation from one of the New Jersey Stateswomen who also happens to be a Yale Alumni. Ive also known her for a considerable amount of time 

\- This is my second time applying 

\- Programs I applied for are PLE and SGC

"Hi, my name is liyah. I’m 13 years old and I wanna rant about my ex gf. Before I get into it, I was in 7th grade when her and I first started talking. She was 31. In April 2025, me and this woman started talking, her and I were in the same fandom, so we had that in common. She lived in South Africa. It started friendly, we would just talk about Kamala Harris, (we both had a thing for older woman). We talked explicitly about her, but she was never explicitly about me personally. After a couple weeks I started to form a crush on her, I’m gonna call her Megan. I would hint it subtly to her, but I thought she liked me back so I thought it was okay. In may she asked me if I liked her, I said yes. She told me she didn’t like me and that she doesn’t date little kids. I was sad but I understood. 5 days later I was sent to a mental hospital for 2 weeks. All I thought about in that mental hospital was her. When I go out, it was the end of May, the first thing I did was text her. Her exact words “hey lia 😁 the way i just smiled at my phone when i saw your message, i missed you 🥺” when I saw that, i was so happy, she missed me. After that we just talked all day everyday, for about 2 weeks. It was friendly, just talking about our day and Kamala. I still had a crush on her. In the beginning of June, the flirting began. We started flirting, teasing. We also started sexting. Pet names were flowing frequently now, in every text. She would send me pictures, and I’d sent her pics. We’d talk each other through our orgasms and send voice notes. Beyond that, she made me feel special. “My gorgeous girl” “you’re so beautiful”. I’m insecure, and she was the only person who made me feel beautiful. I started to fall in love with her, we had a 6 hour time difference, she was 6 hours ahead of me. All I wanted to do was talk to her, so when she woke up, which was 1am EST, I would still be awake. I’d stay up all night to talk to her. When she went to bed, 6pm EST, I’d go to bed. I didn’t wanna be awake without talking to her. When I was asleep I’d dream about her, how much I loved her and how much I wish I could see her. Megan and I got a lot closer, and she told me she was so attached to me and that she loved me. I was actually so happy to hear her say that, I’ve loved her for a while. After that we said “i love you” all the time and she would say such sweet things to me. “I’m here for you baby” “ I’m not going anywhere, get some rest” “mommy’s here” she knew I had attachment issues and mommy issues, and she healed them. She promised to never leave me, and I believed her. She listened and comfort me when I would send her voice notes crying and when I would vent to her about my dad. She cared. She listened. When no one else did. Even when we were sexting or talking explicitly, she made me feel loved and special. Mid June she told me she liked me, like LIKED me. I told her I liked her back. And boom, we started dated. All I ever wanted. The next few weeks were the best weeks of my life, truly. We called, and texted all day long. Her voice made me feel so safe, she has a lil South African accent that I loved. She would talk to me until I feel asleep. July 17th, I got in a big fight with my mom, and I hurt myself. My last texts to Megan before getting sent to another mental hospital were nudes. I was in that mental hospital for a whole month. It was really hard, all I wanted was Megan. All I did was talk and share about her. August 18th, I got out of the mental hospital. I texted her, saying I missed her so much and that I love her more than anything. She responded, her exact words “hey lia to be honest i also missed u alot has happened since we last talked im gonna start working in a few weeks. im officially dating my teacher and got 94% on my nursing test.” My heart sunk. Shes dating her professor. That whole night, I cried, and cried and cried. My baby cheated on me. The next morning I texted her back, it was angry and full of hurt, but she needed to know what she did was wrong. I came out of the mental hospital happy and ready for change, but this destroyed me again. Over the next few days all I did was cry and have panic attacks. I couldn’t talk to anyone, no one knew her and I were together, because again, it was an illegal relationship. The only people who knew were my close friends, who told me to leave her, and that she’s grooming me and that she’s a player, but I didn’t listen. I knew she was a fucking pedo and she was disgusting, but I just looked at her with eyes full of love and affection. A week after I sent that text, I started to get really possessive, saying I’m gonna find her and that I’ll kill her professor. I know I was being crazy, but I was so angry and hurt. She blocked me, and I was heartbroken. Just 2 months ago you were telling me you loved me. Everyday, I still cried myself to sleep. Part of me thinks she took advantage of my age and my love and just used me for my body, but the other part of me wants me to believe that she did love me. It’s October, almost 2 months since she blocked me, and I still cry every night and can’t breathe. I just want my sweet girl. Where did my sweet girl go. Late at night I get in my head, was it because I’m not skinny? Because I’m too young? Too ugly? Even though I know she’s a pedo and isn’t good for me, I can’t help but yearn for her everyday. I hope she texts me one day, saying she loves me. But I know that won’t happen.",Kamala,positive

They’ve been committed to the genocide of Palestinians since forever.

They’ve fully backed Dementia Joe’s fascist deportation policy “as long as it isn’t Trump.”

Kamala was their girl even though she committed to making the US “the most lethal fighting force in history.”

"Hi everybody,

I'm a 27-year-old from Europe. I have a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology and an MSc in Biostatistics. I worked for 2.5 years in a large CRO as an epidemiologist in the RWE division. However, I didn’t enjoy the job and recently decided to move to a research hospital, where I now work as a biostatistician on a one-year contract ending in September 2026.

That said, I’m a bit disappointed with the biostatistician role. In large companies (like CROs), the analyses often feel quite basic and unstimulating, and most of the effort goes into producing extremely detailed technical documentation according to SOPs and dealing with sponsors who often lack even a basic understanding of clinical statistics. On top of that, these companies tend to put a lot of pressure on employees with very strict deadlines, and I’ve seen many colleagues change companies after just a couple of years out of frustration.

Working in research is more interesting in terms of topics and day-to-day activities, but it often feels like the goal is to run analyses endlessly until something turns out significant enough to publish. In addition, research contracts are usually short-term, and the pay is much lower than in CROs or pharma.

Finally, there’s the growing role of AI, which might make statistical programming less relevant in the near future. (Since I have an MSc, statistical programming is one of my possible career paths, but I worry that in a few years, statistical programmers may no longer be needed because of AI.)

I’ve also considered applying for a PhD, but the idea of pursuing a research career doesn’t really appeal to me. I’m Italian, and being a researcher here often means earning around €1500 a month until you’re 35, making it almost impossible to buy a house or start a family. Nor does getting a PhD just to end up in a CRO or pharma company doing, at best, logistic regressions.

All things considered, I’m thinking about switching to a non-technical role, such as Clinical Trial Coordinator, Project Manager, or something similar.

What do you think? Has anyone here made the switch from biostatistics to clinical operations? Are there any specific courses or training programs you would recommend?

Thank you all in advance.",Europe,neutral

FLEXSEAL!!! NOW FOR ONLY 29.99!!!!

(note: anywhere in europe is fine!)

Helloo fellow date-needing people. Ill cut straight to the chase! Im a 26 year old guy, ive been single for a while now and focusing on myself and i believe my heart is ready to try again and who knows, maybe find that special someone that i can connect with on every aspect, see into eachother's souls and vibe together like you haven't before, someone that can make you feel like you're flying all the time and give you the safest of spaces in the world :) (and also someone that will tell you all the fun facts about animals when going to the zoo)

A little about me and my hobbies:

Currently i am in Poland getting my Masters degree in architecture! Its going great and I'm experiencing a lot of new things!

And yes profession wise i am an Architect! Been so for a couple years, its hard but creative and thats what makes ya endure the dumbass work environment haha

I like to draw (mostly buildings for obvious reasons) but i also love to 3d model and make props and trinkets from shows and movies i like!

Speaking of, movies! I watch them, a lot. Nothing beats a cold winter night with a nice movie and a cup of hot cocoa in hand :)

Games! I love playing games like minecraft and stardew, but i mostly indulge in single player and indie games!

And i asked my best friend to describe me and he said ""hectic, unstable, and weird but in a """"wtf is happening with this dude im intrigued"""" kind of way""

As for music i listen to anything pop, rap, and indie! 
Some of Favourite artists are Kendrick lamar, post malone, imagine dragons, 21 pilots, arctic monkeys, the 1975 and the weeknd

So...take of that as you will xD

Id like to think im an empathetic, affectionate man. The most important thing to me in any relationship is communication so ill always make sure we talk about everything, no insecurity or overthinking is allowed! Im looking to find that spark. That ""woah... Am i falling in love?"" Kind of thing :) beggers cant be choosers but hey, if you put a goal in mind and work for it then you get it!

My preference:

Honestly i dont have much, as long as you're above 18, and are willing to chat whenever you're free (but life gets in the way so its understandable when you have off days!), then this post is for you!! Oh and maybe there is a +1 for people in Europe haha, similar timezone and all!

And lastly, if you ask for a picture i shall send one no probelm :)

Dont hesitate to reach out! if you find this post, it means im still looking :) have a great night!!

Toodles~

"So I have genetic dark circles and no sleep or rest fixes them. I frequently get asked whether I slept well and it's annoying. When I tilt my head backwards the dark cicles kind of disappear entirely, but when I look straight you can see them and when looking down it's even worse. I will be attending a wedding in a few weeks and would love to lessen the looks of my dark circles. I don't have to eliminate it entirely because I know you need a lot more than just a concealer to fix that, plus it will not look natural. I live in Europe, just to be clear in regards to product recommendations. The color of my dark circles is purplish. Here are two photos, First one in daylight the second one in bathroom lighting.

"Sultan Abdul Mejid held a keen interest in Western culture, which was vogue among the cosmopolitan elite of the 19th century Eastern Mediterranean. In addition to playing the piano well, he hosted many musicians from Europe at his palace. Among them, his most brilliant visitor was Franz Liszt, who arrived in Constantinople in the summer of 1847. Europe had been praising the virtuoso pianist and prolific composer for years, to the point where the word ""Lisztomania"", which refers to the craze of all things Liszt, gripped Europe at the time. He led a lavish and flamboyant life, moving from high-society salons to concert halls as a bon viveur. Three times this lifestyle had dragged him to Russia, where he met and became attached to the passionate Princess Caroline de Sayn-Wittgenstein in Kiev in February 1847. Following discussions with Grand Vizier Mustafa Reşid Pasha and Alphonse de Lamartine, who was a friend of Liszt, he continued the next leg of his tour in Turkey.

The ""king of pianists"" disembarked in Istanbul on 8 June, dazzled by the views of the Golden Horn and the Bosphorus. He was welcomed by Giuseppe Donizetti, Instructor General of the Imperial Ottoman Music, who would guide him during his stay. Thanks to his immense fame, the musician was personally received by the sultan at Çırağan Palace. The two men conversed in French. ""I was greatly surprised that His Majesty was so aware of my fame,"" Liszt wrote. In the presence of Abdul Mejid, who was very fond of Italian opera, Liszt performed three opera pieces: *Andante* from *Lucia di Lammermoor*, the overture to Rossini’s *William Tell*, and *Norma*. According to the press, the sultan listened to the concert with ""increasing interest, astonishment, and admiration."" The piano played by Liszt had been specially sent from Paris by the Erard company. The sultan awarded his guest with the Order of Glory (Nişân-ı İftihâr) and presented him with a jeweled snuffbox and a silver hookah.

Liszt stayed in a building on Polonya (Poland) Street, near the French Palace, provided by the piano manufacturer Carlmann, 11 (or 19) Nuri Ziya street, Beyoğlu. A plaque on that building still reminds passersby today that the famous composer stayed there. He gave concerts twice at Çırağan Palace, once at the Russian Embassy for a charitable cause, at the Hotel d’Europe, and at the Franchini mansion in Büyükdere. He could not perform at the Pera Opera House (Naum Theater), as the wooden building constructed in 1842 had been reduced to ashes in one of the frequent fires in the capital, and a new stone opera house with a capacity of fourteen hundred people was under construction. Tickets were 100 *kuruş.* Another pianist that found himself in Constantinople by the name of Listmann also gave concerts and tried to capitalize on the fame of his ""partial namesake"" by deleting the second syllable of his name in his promotions.

"I need some honest advice. There’s a guy from my mom’s side of the family. We’re both 21. He’s living in Europe, very well-mannered, prays regularly, and has a really good bond with my mom.

We’ve seen each other once, and recently started talking. As a Muslim girl, I told him clearly that I don’t want any haram relationship. He said he feels the same and only wants something serious. He told me he likes me a lot and said, “never think about another man, you’re only mine.”

He’s very sure that he wants to talk to his mom about sending a rishta. I even told him to wait for some time, but he said he really wants to talk now. He also said he’ll get married once he’s more settled and builds his own house in Lahore.

He has zero female following on social media, respects family, and even said he’ll teach me cooking after marriage since I don’t know much.

He seems genuine, but I still want to be careful. What kind of questions should I ask him to check compatibility? And how can I be sure he’s really serious and will actually send the rishta?",Europe,positive

"I used to be really into photography (pre-digital days) and later was an early DSLR enthusiast (Canon Rebel XT - still have it!). Over the years I had several pocket cameras, but mostly used my iPhone for convenience. 

I have a new use case however - tabletop macro. My work has become more electronics related and I find im often needing to document small electronics projects (PCBs, panels, wiring, inspection) and making videos of devices in action. My phone, even though recent, is poor at macro and handling bright LEDs and tricky room situations. I did a lot of research here and decided to upgrade my tools and get a real macro setup.

So I took the plunge today:  
\- used **Olympus** **OM-D E-M5 Mark III** (\~650 EUR)  
\- Olympus **M.Zuiko 45mm F1.8**  (\~250 EUR)  
\- M **Zuiko Digital ED 60mm Macro 2.8** (\~280 EUR)  
all in = \~1200 EUR for body+2 lenses

My hope is that I chose the right parts. All of it is used (ordered locally, in europe), the camera body has the flash, carry strap and an extra battery but no box. It's out of warranty I believe. 

Is there anything else that I might need? For the macro lens, what kind of distance might I expect to shoot from, and do I need any kind of adaptor? With electronics I am hoping that the focus stacking feature can really help, as it's more about documentation than art. 

And I would love to hear any advice if M5.3 owners out there suggest how to approach learning this camera, as it's been many years since I tried to do serious photography! ",Europe,neutral

It  happens to me (25F) when a man who is not neccearily super good looking, but has those traits: tall, confident, slim, cold eyes and raises his voice at me. Tie, button up shit, confidence, authority and is older.

A manager (46M) belittled me, spoke down to me (because he is an American, while I am from Eastern Europe - told me we took over their processes and do a bad joke of workl), raised his voice, made me feel bad about myself, asked me if I even read what he wrote and so on. Also said its not optional I go with his concerns to my own manager, its MANDATORY. He said he doesn't care its not my fault or who;s fault it is. Even North K..REA can be. He wants it fixed.

I keep blaming myself because I called him without properly reading what he wrote. That request got actually to another colleague but my boss said: because you and him are both Polish (true) it will be better for you to take over. I had 10 minutes left in my shift and a doctor appointemnt. So i read like half of the long thing and called him to discuss it via phone. It was my mistake and maybe I made him upset. it was my fault he treated me that way and he is nice

I reported him. A guy from headquarters called him out himself because I am actually a very good and reliable employee so everyone was on my side. But instead of seeing this, and being happy for this, I want him to see me, to change his opinion on me. I heard he is married and I think oh wow she must be very special and I am inferior. He doesn't raise his voice at her. He loves her and treats her so good.

for some reason I want to prove him I am worthy, I am intelligent. I want his validation so much. He is not like that to me only, he speaks to other the same way.

Why this happens? And only with this type. I stand up for myself with men I don't find intimidating and with women is also very easy. I do have male attention, enough of it. and they treat me nice and want to date me. So I really have no idea. This man made me cry fro 20 minutes in the bathroom and I wanted to quit.

"DeepSeek just released a pretty shocking new paper. They really buried the lede here by referring to it simply as DeepSeek OCR. 

While it’s a very strong OCR model, the purpose of it and the implications of their approach go far beyond what you’d expect of “yet another OCR model.”

Traditionally, vision LLM tokens almost seemed like an afterthought or “bolt on” to the LLM paradigm. And 10k words of English would take up far more space in a multimodal LLM when expressed as intelligible pixels than when expressed as tokens.

So those 10k words may have turned into 15k tokens, or 30k to 60k “visual tokens.” So vision tokens were way less efficient and really only made sense to use for data that couldn’t be effectively conveyed with words. 

But that gets inverted now from the ideas in this paper. DeepSeek figured out how to get 10x better compression using vision tokens than with text tokens! So you could theoretically store those 10k words in just 1,500 of their special compressed visual tokens.

This might not be as unexpected as it sounds if you think of how your own mind works. After all, I know that when I’m looking for a part of a book that I’ve already read, I imagine it visually and always remember which side of the book it was on and approximately where on the page it was, which suggests some kind of visual memory representation at work.

Now, it’s not clear how exactly this interacts with the other downstream cognitive functioning of an LLM; can the model reason as intelligently over those compressed visual tokens as it can using regular text tokens? Does it make the model less articulate by forcing it into a more vision-oriented modality? 

But you can imagine that, depending on the exact tradeoffs, it could be a very exciting new axis to greatly expand effective context sizes. Especially when combined with DeepSeek’s other recent paper from a couple weeks ago about sparse attention.

For all we know, Google could have already figured out something like this, which could explain why Gemini has such a huge context size and is so good and fast at OCR tasks. If they did, they probably wouldn’t say because it would be viewed as an important trade secret.

But the nice thing about DeepSeek is that they’ve made the entire thing open source and open weights and explained how they did it, so now everyone can try it out and explore.

Even if these tricks make attention more lossy, the potential of getting a frontier LLM with a 10 or 20 million token context window is pretty exciting. 

You could basically cram all of a company’s key internal documents into a prompt preamble and cache this with OpenAI and then just add your specific query or prompt on top of that and not have to deal with search tools and still have it be fast and cost-effective. 

Or put an entire code base into the context and cache it, and then just keep appending the equivalent of the git diffs as you make changes to the code. 

If you’ve ever read stories about the great physicist Hans Bethe, he was known for having vast amounts of random physical facts memorized (like the entire periodic table; boiling points of various substances, etc.) so that he could seamlessly think and compute without ever having to interrupt his flow to look something up in a reference table. 

Having vast amounts of task-specific knowledge in your working memory is extremely useful. This seems like a very clever and additive approach to potentially expanding that memory bank by 10x or more.

"So i discovered the world of selfhosting when I was just tinkering my first linux installation and exploring FOSS alternatives to big tech products. Started a simple ubuntu server as a hyper-V virtual machine on a powerful workstation laptop I always keep plugged in. Using docker I’ve successfully set up and migrated everything to immich, nextcloud, jellyfin, etc. I also ran umami to monitor some interesting activities on my website (hosted using git pages). 

Now, after moving back to my parents’ place, I found an “old” macbook pro from 2017 with a broken screen. Ended up upgrading the SSD to 2TB using a third party adapter and installed ubuntu server. With i5 7360U and 8GB of memory it does most of my things with no issue at all. Now I can fully utilize the workstation’s computing power for gaming and work related simulation tasks without having yo constantly bleeding its resources to hyper-V.

Technically I have no issues. Sure, the broadcom network chip in the macbook doesn’t allow connecting to 5Ghz wifi at home so the network speed is capped. Cumbersome to troubleshoot with a broken screen, but power on AC works pretty well and tailscale SSH allows me to easily remotely manage the server.

But I can’t stop myself from wanting more: Proxmox, large HDDs, even a local LLM. These things are not really necessary to me, but I just can’t help but feeling like this old macbook with a broken screen is just not good enough. I remind you again it is sufficient for all the things I really need in my life.

And this made me curious: when does it get “good enough”, where you stop wanting more and more? When was it for you guys? Was it your first dedicated hardware setup? Or was it when you got a super fast internet installed? When you had enough redundancy so that even if two HDDs fail at the same time none of your data would be lost?

"IBM announced a new strategic partnership with Groq, the company behind the insanely fast Language Processing Unit (LPU) chips designed for AI inference.

Here’s what’s actually happening — and why investors should care 👇

⸻

🧠 The deal:
	•	Integration: Groq’s GroqCloud will plug directly into IBM’s watsonx Orchestrate platform — letting enterprise clients run large AI models (and agents) with much faster inference times.
	•	Performance: Groq claims its hardware can deliver up to 5× faster inference than GPUs for certain workloads.
	•	Open AI stack: The collaboration also involves vLLM and IBM Granite models — part of IBM’s open and hybrid AI strategy (via Red Hat + watsonx).
	•	Use case focus: “Agentic AI” — systems that don’t just analyze data but act autonomously (customer support, logistics, compliance, etc.) — at enterprise scale and speed.

⸻

⚙️ Why it matters
	•	IBM gets speed + scalability — a major missing piece for enterprise AI deployment.
	•	Groq gets credibility + clients — access to IBM’s global enterprise base.
	•	Together: They aim to make real-time AI agents viable for production use — where latency, compliance, and cost matter most.

This positions IBM as a rare “AI orchestration + infrastructure” hybrid player — not competing head-on with Nvidia, but complementing and potentially undercutting them on enterprise inference.

⸻

⚠️ Risks & watchpoints
	•	Real-world performance still needs validation.
	•	Integration into legacy enterprise systems could be complex.
	•	Nvidia and Intel aren’t standing still — competition in AI inference is brutal.

⸻

💡 Takeaway

This isn’t hype — it’s infrastructure.
IBM is quietly arming itself for the next phase of AI adoption: from lab demos to enterprise production.
If Groq’s claims hold up, IBM could become the go-to orchestrator for fast, compliant, and scalable AI across industries.",LLM,positive

[Samesurf is the inventor of modern co-browsing and a pioneer in the development of core systems for Agentic AI.](https://samesurf.com/our-technology/patents/)

The rise of Agentic AI marks the most significant shift in enterprise technology since Generative AI. Moving beyond simple automation to true autonomy requires more than powerful Large Language Models; it demands a secure, specialized, and patented infrastructure capable of executing complex web interactions. Samesurf, the inventor of modern co-browsing, delivers this foundation through its Simulated Browsing and In-Page Control Passing technologies.

# The Shift from Reactive Tools to Proactive Collaborators

Current AI tools, including standard LLMs, are largely reactive, responding only to prompts or generating summaries. Agentic AI moves beyond this, autonomously perceiving digital environments, reasoning, planning, and executing complex tasks without constant human oversight.

For businesses, this shift is transformative. Agentic AI not only improves efficiency but also boosts operational agility and enables entirely new workflows. AI-enabled devices automate complex processes, deliver personalized customer experiences, and perform sophisticated data analysis that previously required human intervention. For small and mid-sized businesses, Agentic AI provides leverage to scale operations and enhance margins. 

# The Digital Challenge of Bridging Intelligence and Action

For an AI agent to achieve true autonomy, it must reliably interact with the web, which serves as the primary interface for modern commerce, support, and enterprise software. This requirement introduces a fundamental challenge: how to provide LLM intelligence with a dependable, standardized method for taking action in a highly dynamic and unstructured web environment.

Traditional web automation methods, such as Robotic Process Automation, are notoriously brittle and require constant maintenance whenever a website’s underlying code changes. Legacy collaboration solutions, like remote desktop systems, are invasive, demanding local software installs, granting full system access, and creating significant security and performance risks.

Adding to the complexity is a critical security concern. Web AI agents, due to their structural design for web interaction, are significantly more vulnerable to following malicious commands compared with standalone, isolated LLMs. This risk makes secure enterprise deployment challenging and underscores the need for a controlled execution environment that can neutralize threats proactively. Samesurf’s patented Simulated Browsing, powered by the Cloud Browser, provides this essential infrastructure. By creating a protected environment where the AI-enabled device can perceive and interact with the web like a human user, Samesurf separates intelligence from execution, enabling advanced AI models to operate safely and reliably within high-stakes digital workflows.

# Samesurf’s Foundational IP

Samesurf’s leadership in Agentic AI is grounded in its extensive and validated intellectual property portfolio, holding multiple USPTO patents in simulated browsing dating back over a decade, with priority dates as early as May 20, 2010, including patent 9,483,448. The foundational authority of this technology was confirmed when the Patent Trial and Appeal Board upheld all 16 claims of the core ‘448 patent as valid. This long-standing IP foundation provides the stability and authority necessary to build and deploy the next generation of AI-enabled applications for Fortune 100 clients.

Building on this simulated browsing foundation, Samesurf secured two recently issued patents, 12,101,361 and 12,088,647, with priority dates of February 17, 2023, which specifically disclose foundational elements for Agentic AI. These patents formally address the role of autonomous entities within the browsing ecosystem. They define system flows where session participants may include AI-enabled devices alongside human users, confirming that AI agents can “simulate the role of a human user via scripting, customized programming, integration with an artificial intelligence component, or any other simulated medium.”

This formal inclusion of AI agents as equivalent peers within the shared browsing system represents a crucial architectural distinction. It goes beyond external manipulation tools by creating an integrated environment of co-agency, allowing the AI-enabled device to fully inhabit the role of a user. This integrated participation is essential for handling complex, multi-step tasks, such as customer onboarding or technical support, where the AI agent must experience the content flow and context alongside a human participant.

Samesurf’s patents also define the operational architecture required to manage these autonomous interactions. The system relies on the precise role and operation of five critical components: AI-enabled or human host and guest devices, cloud browsers, synchronization servers, encoders, and automated systems that redact sensitive elements using machine learning.

# Simulated Browsing and the Cloud Browser Paradigm

Simulated Browsing is the core mechanism that enables AI agents to operate autonomously on the web. Powered by the Cloud Browser, it allows the agent to replicate human navigation and interaction, including clicks and data entry, across single or multiple browser tabs and any form of online content. This Cloud Browser-based approach provides a significant architectural advantage over traditional screen scraping or headless browsing. By processing raw frames and data streams, the system delivers a standardized, high-fidelity representation of content, overcoming graphical fidelity and platform inconsistency issues that often limit legacy automation methods. A key feature that drives rapid adoption is the platform’s code-free and install-free deployment model. Simulated Browsing requires no code placement, client-side installs, or complex IT network modifications, eliminating IT friction and enabling AI agents to reliably navigate web experiences that are not controlled by the deploying company, such as a purchasing agent interacting with a third-party supplier portal. This low-friction deployment, achieved through secure server-side integration via a REST API, is essential for scaling Agentic AI solutions across the enterprise.

Samesurf’s foundational technology ensures true ubiquity for autonomous agents, supporting synchronous, multi-user functionality across any web-enabled device, browser, or system. This capability extends Agentic AI beyond conventional PC-based workflows into the growing ecosystem of AI-enabled devices and the Internet of Things. With support for mobile applications on iOS and Android, as well as generic web dashboards, Simulated Browsing allows AI agents to interact with complex web interfaces on smart devices. For example, an AI agent could securely navigate a smart factory control panel to proactively adjust settings, such as regulating a smart AC system based on real-time temperature telemetry. By operating within a controlled, secure environment and using standard HTTPS ports 80 and 443, the platform avoids the [complexity and security](https://samesurf.com/redefining-insurance-with-agentic-ai/) risks associated with opening new ports or making network modifications.

# In-Page Control Passing for Human-AI Oversight

Autonomy, particularly in high-stakes enterprise applications, must be paired with robust governance. For decision-making AI agents, the ability to observe, supervise, and intervene is essential for ensuring trust and safety. Samesurf’s patents explicitly define interactions where a human “observes, supervises and/or intervenes” via features such as In-Page Control Passing. This patented feature enables non-invasive transfer of navigational control between an AI agent and a human user, or among multiple human collaborators, all within the same web page. Control is passed without relinquishing device control or system access, providing instant, contextual assistance. This allows an AI agent to hand control to a human expert when encountering an unforeseen edge case or system error, without the security and performance risks associated with full remote desktop access.

Unlike traditional automation, where a failure halts the process and requires a human restart, Samesurf’s architecture transforms error handling into a collaborative moment. When an AI agent reaches a roadblock, the Control Passing mechanism instantly transfers navigation to a human supervisor within the exact context of the web page where the issue occurred. This reduces downtime and significantly lowers Mean Time to Resolution, while ensuring the entire supervised session is recorded for audit and compliance purposes. Advanced features like Multi-Leader Mode allow multiple collaborators to interact with content simultaneously without manually passing control. This is critical for complex tasks requiring immediate co-agency, such as a human verifying sensitive credentials while the AI agent completes ancillary fields. By enabling secure, contextual handoffs, Samesurf [establishes supervised autonomy](https://samesurf.com/building-trusted-ai-agents-with-samesurfs-technology/) as a standard governance layer, making sophisticated AI agents viable in mission-critical enterprise environments.

# Achieving Enterprise-Grade Trust

Samesurf’s validated IP and advanced technology make it the essential execution and governance layer for the Agentic Enterprise, translating LLM planning and reasoning into secure, scalable, actionable steps in the digital world. Its competitive moat, built on 15 years of simulated browsing expertise combined with new patents explicitly naming AI agents, protects its position and ensures operational reliability.

The platform’s install-free, code-free deployment via a secure REST API [maximizes flexibility](https://samesurf.com/how-agentic-ai-systems-are-revolutionizing-travel/) and avoids IT friction while allowing enterprises to integrate Samesurf seamlessly into existing digital workflows. By embedding autonomous, patented compliance mechanisms, Samesurf ensures that AI-enabled operations meet legal and regulatory requirements regardless of future policy shifts, focusing enterprise investment on durable and lawful execution.

Samesurf bridges the gap between AI intelligence and autonomous execution through its patented infrastructure. Simulated Browsing gives the AI-enabled agent digital control, while In-Page Control Passing provides essential human oversight. This architecture delivers a secure, cross-platform, and inherently compliant framework, enabling enterprises to deploy complex, supervised AI agents immediately and transition Agentic AI from emerging technology to a trusted, fully integrated operational reality.

"Deepseek Just droped DeepSeek-OCR, Compressing Text via the Vision Modality

The ""OCR"" part of the name is a bit of a head-fake. The interesting bit is the core idea: using the vision modality as a high-ratio compressor for text to feed into an LLM.

The standard approach is to tokenize text into a 1D sequence of discrete integer IDs. This sequence gets very long for large documents, which becomes the primary computational and memory bottleneck (i.e., the KV cache).

This model takes a different path. It renders the text as an image, feeds it through a vision encoder (ViT), and gets a much shorter sequence of continuous vector embeddings (e.g., ~100 vision tokens for a page that might be ~6,000 text tokens).
The LLM then operates directly on this short sequence of vision tokens.

The core observation is that a single, continuous-valued vision token is a much more information-dense primitive than a single discrete text token ID. The vision encoder is effectively a learned, lossy text compressor. The paper claims a ~10:1 compression ratio with ""near-lossless"" text recovery.

This is a neat way to attack the long-context problem by just changing the input representation. It also naturally unifies text with non-text elements (formulas, tables, diagrams) that are typically very awkward for text tokenizers. The LLM just ""sees"" the page layout.

Obviously, the trade-off is the large vision encoder up front, but you only run it once. The subsequent LLM (which is the N^2 part) operates on a 10x smaller sequence.
It'll be interesting to see how robust this visual representation is for fine-grained reasoning tasks compared to operating on the text tokens directly. But as a new primitive for ""stuffing"" docs into context, it's a very clever idea.

"AI Mode is rolling out to more regions and languages, and more source links are appearing directly inside the AI answer box, which means visibility now hinges on being cited in the answer itself, not on chasing a blue link below it.​

Why this matters

* When answers include inline links, attention and trust shift to the sources named inside the AI summary, so citation becomes the distribution advantage as organic clicks compress.​
* Early adopters are pulling ahead because AI answers front‑load outcomes; the brand cited at the top wins the click and the mindshare before traditional results get a look.​

What to do this week

* Turn your H2/H3 into questions and put a 1–2 sentence direct answer immediately below each header to match how AI extracts and links concise fragments.​
* Add a tight FAQ near the end with short, standalone answers that a model can quote verbatim inside AI Mode responses, with appropriate schema when relevant.​
* Keep structure unbroken at publish: predictable headings, short paragraphs, and clean HTML through your CMS so your extractable blocks survive to production.​
* Cover the whole topic with concise sections and interlink related pages using descriptive anchors to increase context without bloating the core answer fragments.​

Mini example (format, not fluff)

* H2: What’s the fastest way to earn AI citations ?​
* Answer: Write a question‑style header and place a crisp 1–2 sentence answer immediately below, then support it with schema and internal links for depth without diluting the extractable block.​

Signals this is working

* You start seeing your brand linked inside AI answers on priority queries as AI Mode adds coverage across markets and languages, not just on traditional SERPs.​
* Downstream metrics improve even as classic organic clicks flatten, because being named inside the answer moves you into the decision space earlier.​

Where [outwrite.ai](http://outwrite.ai) fits (light mention)  
[Outwrite.ai](http://Outwrite.ai) researches your topic, generates citation‑ready drafts with optimized headings, Q&A blocks, short answer fragments, and schema, scores them on LLM‑citation factors, and publishes in one click to WordPress and Shopify so your structure lands intact end‑to‑end.​  
Teams using this approach report outcomes like first inbound mentions “found via ChatGPT,” plus case studies showing 4.4x more inbound meetings after adopting AI‑optimized structures that protect extractability at publish.​

Short, skimmable version (6–8 lines)

* AI Mode is expanding and putting more links inside answers—citation is the new distribution edge.​
* Write headers as questions, answer in 1–2 sentences under each to mirror extraction.​
* Add a compact FAQ with short, quotable answers plus relevant schema.​
* Keep HTML clean and headings consistent through your CMS.​
* Interlink with descriptive anchors to boost context density without fluff.​
* [outwrite.ai](http://outwrite.ai) ships citation‑ready drafts, scores for LLM citation, and publishes in one click.​

Question for the room: If you refactor one page this week into question‑answer blocks, which query do you want AI Mode to cite you for first—and what’s your 1–2 sentence answer fragment ?",LLM,positive
"We were acquired last year and lost most of the central Quality support we previously relied on. Some ways of working existed in reality (maybe 50%), but documentation was weak and scattered. I was tasked to rebuild the IMS/QMS almost from scratch. In 6 months we built a full system, created \~130 documents, and passed external audit with no major/minor NCs and a couple of OFIs.

AI was a force-multiplier, but always with a human in the loop. Not a single policy or process was “hallucinated”. Anything that did not reflect reality was pushed back, corrected, and, where needed, implemented in practice well before audit. The auditor feedback highlighted strong objective evidence of defined and followed IMS/QMS processes which I think is evidence of no ""AI"" cheating.

**What AI/LLM actually helped with**

* ISO 9001 clause scoping and prioritizing where to focus, we used this [GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-1xaTovAVf-iso-9001-advisor) (*which I am not the author of)*.
* Rewriting human-drafted policies and processes so they are readable and audit-ready
* Cross-checking assumptions (“is this clause even relevant for this process?”) by using above referenced GPT.
* Making KPIs S.M.A.R.T and clearly measurable
* Coding some of the Confluence Policy/Process tracking tooling (via REST API) in Excel/VBA *(we used Confluence to document the IMS/QMS and needed to track the lifecycle in an easy way)*
* Risk & Opportunity refinement (I’ve posted separately about that)
* Internal audit preparation: we ran a strong internal audit early, sometimes used an AI-assisted RCA tool to get to good root causes (posted about that earlier), and fixed all NCs before the external audit

**Guardrails we enforced**

* No AI-generated “fantasy” processes, everything reflects actual practice
* If a gap was found, we changed the way of working first, documented after
* AI is an augmenting and reasoning tool, not a compliance machine
* All outputs reviewed and approved by humans before entering the IMS/QMS
* Confluence with some additional document controls used as the single source of truth for the IMS/QMS

**Cultural observation**  
Nobody resisted, people hate writing policies and processes. As long as it was clear that humans own the content and AI only helps with wording and structure, people were relieved, not threatened.

**Biggest lessons**

* AI accelerates the understanding, prioritization, thinking, and writing parts, but not the discipline to get policies and processes written
* Internal audit + AI-assisted RCA before external audit was helpful but the RCA tool was no game changer, same here - its discipline that matters
* Tracking process maturity and lifecycle rigorously (using above mentioned Excel tool) kept momentum high

I am sure this approach would not fit every organization or auditor context so I'm mainly curious where others draw the line?

If anyone is doing something similar I would be very interested in how you handle:

* Auditors who explicitly ask about AI use (ours didn’t)
* AI-assisted Risk & Opportunity management and RCA has already been discussed here, do you see other good use of AI/LLMs in the future?
* Whether you see any clauses where AI is especially dangerous to use in this way?

"I am currently testing an AI-driven quantitative trading system that combines traditional quantitative signals with the decision-making layer of a large language model. The position and risk are dynamically adjusted based on market sentiment, volatility patterns, and structural capital flow data. 

The following picture shows the 72-hour live trading competition I am currently participating in. Multiple AI models are competing in the real cryptocurrency market (with an initial capital of 10,000 US dollars for each model).

It can be seen that the handling of volatility by each AI model varies significantly.

I am particularly fascinated by: 

Large language models can interpret the transformation of operating patterns that traditional algorithms often overlook. 

The quantization layer is responsible for execution, optimization and risk control. 

This combination of AI intuition and quantitative discipline has achieved astonishing results. 

I'm very curious: 

Has anyone attempted to combine LLM reasoning with a quantitative system? 

How do you view AI-driven real-time trading risk management or reinforcement logic?

"I've spent the past 8 months the trenches, I want to share what actually worked vs. wasted our time. We built RAG for Usul AI (9M pages) and an unnamed legal AI enterprise (4M pages).

# Langchain + Llamaindex

We started out with youtube tutorials. First Langchain -> Llamaindex. Got to a working prototype in a couple of days and were optimistic with the progress. We run tests on subset of the data (100 documents) and the results looked great. We spend the next few days running the pipeline on the production dataset and got everything working in a week — incredible.

Except it wasn’t, the results were subpar and only the end users could tell. We spent the following few months rewriting pieces of the system, one at a time, until the performance was at the level we wanted. Here are things we did ranked by ROI.

# What moved the needle

1. **Query Generation**: not all context can be captured by the user’s last query. We had an LLM review the thread and generate a number of semantic + keyword queries. We processed all of those queries in parallel, and passed them to a reranker. This made us cover a larger surface area and not be dependent on a computed score for hybrid search.
2. **Reranking**: the highest value 5 lines of code you’ll add. The chunk ranking shifted *a lot*. More than you’d expect. Reranking can many times make up for a bad setup if you pass in enough chunks. We found the ideal reranker set-up to be 50 chunk input -> 15 output.
3. **Chunking Strategy**: this takes a lot of effort, you’ll probably be spending most of your time on it. We built a custom flow for both enterprises, make sure to understand the data, review the chunks, and check that a) chunks are not getting cut mid-word or sentence b) \~each chunk is a logical unit and captures information on its own
4. **Metadata to LLM**: we started by passing the chunk text to the LLM, we ran an experiment and found that injecting relevant metadata as well (title, author, etc.) improves context and answers by a lot.
5. **Query routing**: many users asked questions that can’t be answered by RAG (e.g. summarize the article, who wrote this). We created a small router that detects these questions and answers them using an API call + LLM instead of the full-blown RAG set-ups.

# Our stack

* **Vector database:** Azure → Pinecone → Turbopuffer (cheap, supports keyword search natively)
* **Document Extraction:** Custom
* **Chunking:** Unstructured.io by default, custom for enterprises (heard that Chonkie is good)
* **Embedding:** text-embedding-3-large, haven’t tested others
* **Reranker:** None → Cohere 3.5 → Zerank (less known but actually good)
* **LLM:** GPT-4.1 → GPT-5 → GPT-4.1 (covered by Azure credits)

"Last year, I was testing how to get my company to show up in LLM results, and realized that it was sourcing a lot of information from my Instagram bio. I started experimenting with my personal account, changing my bio every few weeks, and it seemed to be indexed and regurgitated by ChatGPT within a day or two after updating. 

Then, in July, there was a public announcement that Google would be indexing public content from Instagram.  I knew it! 

This has me wondering if anyone here has any data or information, even anecdotal, about how social media indexing is impacting their marketing strategy. Has anyone been experimenting with comments to create more topical authority? Any tools out there helping with SEO that include keyword strategy on Instagram captions? What about comments - are they as valuable as google reviews yet?? What's going on out there? What do we know??

"I’ve been building a software platform for the past 6/months, and I’m finally close to launch — about 90% complete. I’m not a developer myself, but I’m technically inclined and have been able to build the platform so far using LLM tools and no-code/low-code solutions. It’s solid for a V1, and I believe it has strong potential to gain traction quickly once launched.

That said, I’m now at the point where I need a technical co-founder,  someone who can help maintain, debug, and iterate as we start to bring users on. I’m also planning to raise funding, and having a technical co-founder would make that process a lot more credible and efficient.

I’m based in the MD/VA area and unfortunately don’t have a large network of engineers or founders to tap into. I work long hours (13–15 hours a day), and I’m looking for someone with a similar work ethic and long-term mindset — someone who’s hungry, resourceful, and wants to build something meaningful from the ground up.

Any advice on how or where to find a solid technical co-founder would be appreciated.  Also open to connecting directly if anyone’s interested in hearing more about the product itself.

"So, you've got this brilliant idea that revolutionise physics and you managed to prompt your LLM of choice into formalising it for you. Good job! Now you'd like to have physicists check it and confirm that it is indeed groundbreaking. The problem is that they are very nitpicky about what content they'll consider and demand in particular a basic understanding of physics from their counterpart. After all, we know that LLMs hallucinate and only with a modicum of expertise is the user able to sort out the nonsense and extract the good stuff. But you ***do*** know physics, right? I mean, you fucking upended it! So, how to convince those pesky gatekeepers that you are indeed competent and worth talking to? Fear no more: I've got you. Just show that you can solve the simple problems below and nobody will be able to deny your competence. Here are the rules of engagement:

* Only handwritten solutions are acceptable.
* Don’t post your solutions here (it could spoil it for other challengers) but rather at the original place where this post was linked.
* Obvious attempts at using LLMs can be sanctioned with the assumption that you don’t indeed know much about basic physics.
* The same goes for word-salads or other attempts at bullshitting your way through the problems: physics is written and discussed in mathematical language.

# 🧠 Why AI Models Rarely Say “I Don’t Know”

1. **They predict, not know.** LLMs don’t “understand” facts — they generate text by predicting the next most likely word. → *Bender & Koller (2020), ACL.*
2. **Training data bias.** In real-world text, humans rarely write *“I don’t know”* in informational contexts. The model learns to **always answer**, even when uncertain. → *Zhao et al. (2021), Lin et al. (2022), ACL.*
3. **Reinforcement learning bias.** During fine-tuning (RLHF), models are rewarded for being *helpful* and *confident*, not for admitting ignorance. Saying “I don’t know” often lowers the reward. → *Ouyang et al. (2022), OpenAI.*
4. **No true metacognition.** LLMs lack mechanisms to assess their own certainty. They can’t internally verify whether a claim is true. → *Kadavath et al. (2023).*
5. **It can be trained — but isn’t standard yet.** Some specialized models (e.g., for science) are explicitly trained to express uncertainty or say “I don’t know.” → *Tay et al. (2023), NeurIPS.*

# 🧩 Summary Table

|Cause|Effect|
|:-|:-|
|Predictive, not cognitive model|No concept of “knowing”|
|Human text bias|Mimics overconfident speech|
|RLHF optimization|Penalizes “I don’t know”|
|Lack of self-assessment|Cannot gauge confidence|

"I've been running A/B tests on SaaS homepages for years — a good test page can boost signups by 20-30%.

The process used to take weeks: analyzing reviews, talking to sales/support, user interviews, compiling research, drafting copy, wireframing, then design files.

Now I use Claude to shrink the process and get a html prototype in a day

**The LLM-accelerated process on a recent project:**

**1. Scraped and analyzed customer reviews**

* Copied 300+ reviews from Capterra into a Google Doc ([example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FHhRGvMMFlZiTl-622WFFeaJVsevwBlIKTUl4tdpj3E/edit?tab=t.0))
* Connected to Claude Project with company context, ICP, goals
* Used 3 prompts:
   * What problems does \[product\] solve? Rank by frequency, include quotes ([example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CzLHTQMmDU2hystrnxA_lg4BWx7QM9G3PO3HadQ2E7g/edit?tab=t.0))
   * What are the top benefits? Same format ([example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BiKsPGwKX9-b2dvrZMKr25jxlEAYtfRqXqpuvvfFVr8/edit?tab=t.0))
   * What objections almost stopped buyers? ([example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11qoORzWNcHMj78t5jtipujwWBfnoj3Y2aKhdPtf1nFo/edit?tab=t.0))

Result: Stack-ranked insights with actual customer language in \~30 minutes

**2. Cross-referenced with sales calls**

* Same analysis on anonymized call transcripts
* Seeing identical themes in both sources = high confidence in insights

**3. Generated first draft copy**

* Prompted Claude to write homepage using customer language (repurposed, not quoted). You'll get more authentic sounding content this way.
* First draft used real customer phrasing instead of generic SaaS speak

**4. Used my LLM tool to generate a prototype**

* Downloaded the original page and uploaded it to the LLM
* Prompted to insert my new copy into the old page
* I get it to monchrome the page and grayscale the images so we can focus on the copy
* More recently I'm getting it to generate the final page

**What worked:**

* Research: 2-3 weeks → a few hours
* Copy felt authentic because it used actual customer language
* Generate prototypes quickly rather than building from scratch in Figma or Balsamiq

**What didn't:**

* LLM hallucinated some customer quotes (had to replace with real ones)
* The copy LLMs write is still generic and needs human editing for tone/flow
* I've had mixed success generating the final page for testing, if the structural changes are small it's definitely doable.

LLMs don't replace the work but they do speed it up by doing the most tedious parts.

With markets closed for Diwali and Balipratipada, this session sets a positive tone for the symbolic Muhurat trading. The technical outlook suggests Nifty could aim for the 26,000-26,200 zone if it holds above the 25,700 support level.

I've written a detailed breakdown on my blog, Money Mentors, which includes a full sector-wise analysis, the list of top 5 gainers and losers, and the impact of global cues.

Nifty has been known to give in general around \~12% . The nifty has hit 52 week high. It was a topsy turvy past year . With wars around and tariffs in place it was kinda choppy around.

Whereas Gold was climbing up rapidly with uncertainty around, lots of investment has been on Gold including the national banks of different countries leading the way.

Recently Silver has been on steroids and it crossed the previous All Time High with sentiments favouring the industrial metal.

We all do have goals, asset allocations, log term and short term investments. This Diwali on Muhurat trading window where are you investing? Nifty or other equity or Gold/Silver?

"Got an email from ***customerawareness****\[AT\]irctc\[DOT\]co\[DOT\]in* supposedly meant for customer awareness. **What kind of awareness is that? About Supreme Dictator?**

Email Notification didn’t talk about trains, tickets, or safety updates. Instead, it included references to the Ram Temple, Operation Sindoor(cover up still going on), Naxalism and Maoist terrorism, GST Bachat Utsav, Biggest Joke of “Viksit” (Developed) and “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India).

None of that has anything to do with IRCTC’s services or Indian Railways. It's a forced Modi's political statement than a IRCTCs customer communication. From GODI MEDIA to GOVT INSTITUTION all are d\*\*k riding Modi at this point. Remember his birthday? Every newspaper front page was plastered with his image.

"Earlier in August, the Supreme Court collegium had proposed transferring Justice Atul Sreedharan, one of the senior-most judges of the Madhya Pradesh High Court, to the Chhattisgarh High Court. However, within a month, the Modi government sought a reconsideration of that decision. Complying with the request, the collegium revised its recommendation, transferring Justice Sreedharan to the Allahabad High Court instead.  
  
While no explanation has been provided by either the collegium or the government for this abrupt change, this now means that Sreedharan will be a junior judge and will not be part of the collegium that selects new judges.  
  
This incident underscores the opacity and possible executive interference that continue to cloud the system of judicial transfers and appointments in India.  
  
Ratna Singh closely examines various events leading to his transfer and discusses what it says about judicial appointments in India.

"(M30) Buongiorno fanciulle e ragazzoni  
  
Ieri ho avuto il primo appuntamento della mia vita nata da un app di incontri...  
Non so bene che fare...dal match su app mi aveva preso molto perche oltre a sembrarmi molto attraente rispetto ai miei gusti (non volgare e molto fine), abbiamo avuto anche una settimana di conversazione comunque piacevole (io sono un po piu caciarone, lei si notava fosse un po piu timida).  
Incontrandoci diciamo non mi ha stupito troppo, da un punto di vista fisico (in foto magari scegli anche un po gli scatti dove vieni meglio) e di scambio (si vede che lei era un po chiusina/timida/leggermente rigida...mi pare sia cosi un po di carattere piu che a causa dell'incontro)  
Non abbiamo avuto particolari momenti di silenzio perchè tra una cosa e l'altra riuscivo sempre ad aprire a discorsi o parlare di qualcosa di interessante o divertente.....una cosa che mi premeva era riuscire magari con alcuni ""spunti"" di portarla ad aprirsi un po e riuscire ad arrivare a un ""layer"" di profondità (emotiva) maggiore (è un po il mio modo per iniziare/provare una connessione)..ma la notavo proprio un po bloccata  
\[Penso di essermi comportato bene comunque, abbiamo fatto aperitivo, si era fatta una certa e gli ho anche chiesto se voleva mangiare qualcosa (acconsentito) e ho pagato io (permettendo di chiedere se gli andava comunque bene...a me piace offrire, soprattutto in questi casi, ma so che a volte puo dar fastidio paradossalmente)

La questione è che non so bene che fare ora: lei comunque è a suo modo molto dolcina e si vede che è un po ""rigida""...durante i discorsi fatti non mi è partito quel particolare entusiasmo o un coinvolgimento  
Non saprei se diciamo ""chiudere"" o provare a vedere se incontrandola di nuovo magari evolve un po la cosa...non vorrei però nemmeno allungare un qualcosa che possa dare poi piu ""speranze"", diciamo, quando però c'è la possibilitò che non mi prenda....  
di base sono una persona a cui dispiace far dispiacere/far del male anche solo indirettamente ....tanto piu appunto se questa persona è comunque molto carina nei modi e mi pare anche una gran brava ragazza ç\_ç",Modi,positive

"Dal sito ufficiale:

COSA OTTIENI QUANDO COMBINI UMORISMO, SURREALISMO E MODA CONCETTUALE? GLENN MARTENS HA VOLUTO SCOPRIRLO.

Disruptivo, curioso e ironico, Glenn Martens è uno dei designer più autentici e creativi della moda contemporanea, con un'estetica sperimentale che unisce irriverenza ed eleganza. Come direttore creativo di Y/Project, ha trasformato il marchio di nicchia in un punto di riferimento a livello mondiale per un design d'avanguardia ma indossabile. 

Da Diesel, Martens ha ridefinito ciò che un gigante del denim può rappresentare nella cultura contemporanea, abbattendo i confini tra lusso, arte e capi di tutti i giorni. Quest'anno, è stato scelto per guidare Maison Margiela, una delle case di moda più audaci dal punto di vista concettuale. Il suo lavoro fonde la leggerezza con la precisione, la fluidità con la struttura, e l'eccentricità con l'eleganza, abbracciando le contraddizioni come una fonte di forza. La filosofia del design di Martens è radicata nella trasformazione e nella molteplicità: i suoi capi sono in continuo cambiamento, incoraggiano l'interazione e resistono ai vincoli convenzionali. Nel suo atelier, la moda diventa sia un inseguimento intellettuale che un'esperienza emotiva: in qualche modo radicale, romantica e ultramoderna, tutto in una volta.

La collezione H&M Glenn Martens trasforma i bestseller dell'archivio H&M e i gesti caratteristici della storia del design di Martens in nuovi classici, che prendono forma come denim manipolato, maglieria intrecciata e destrutturata, abiti stampati delicatamente, capi spalla con fili metallici, trench coat reinventati, gioielli teatrali, stivali che arrivano all'anca e borse che cambiano forma, il tutto con un tocco di stile dell'eredità britannica: “Ho cercato di mettere un'atmosfera aristocratica, britannica nella collezione, basandomi su forme, tessuti e archetipi. Abbiamo tutta la famiglia del tartan, e tutta la maglieria, che è molto scozzese, molto delle Highlands. Poi abbiamo lavorato con molti tweed e tessuti di lana molto ricchi. E abbiamo i trench coat, i cappotti di lana cotta, tutti molto tradizionali in sostanza ma con un twist di Glenn Martens. I capi sono tutti rivestiti e con fili metallici, quindi si possono effettivamente ricostruire. Da lontano potresti dire, ok questo è un giubbotto di tweed molto classico. Ma una volta che lo hai tra le mani, puoi vedere che è completamente di un altro mondo.”

Questo ha portato al suo concetto di campagna: “Volevo che la campagna ritraesse un gruppo assurdo di persone per riflettere il fatto che gli archetipi della collezione sono molto diversi. Quindi l'idea di un ritratto di famiglia mi sembrava molto adatta. Inoltre, poiché la collezione ha un tipo di 'britannicità', ho pensato che sarebbe stato divertente mettere uno spin eccentrico sul tipo di ritratto aristocratico o reale che si vedrebbe nel diciannovesimo secolo. L'atmosfera della famiglia reale britannica è leggendaria, è quasi come una favola vivente. Ti porta veramente in un altro mondo, e volevo che la campagna esistesse in parallelo a quel mondo.”

Gli iconici britannici Joanna Lumley e Richard E. Grant sono entrati nei ruoli di matriarca e patriarca di una famiglia immaginaria della moda di Glenn Martens, supportati da un cast diversificato di ensemble per interpretare gli “adolescenti”, tra cui i modelli Clym Evernden, Audrey Marnay, Jum Kuochnin, Heather Diamond Strongarm e Clara Denison.

“Vedo la collezione come una grande famiglia di capi,” ha spiegato Martens, “tutti con scopi e punti di partenza diversi. Tutti hanno personalità diverse in momenti diversi — formali, informali, vistosi, discreti, trasgressivi, classici — e possono essere interpretati in modi diversi. Proprio come le persone, sono se stessi, ma stanno anche cambiando, crescendo e si sentono diversi ogni giorno.”

H&M Glenn Martens sarà disponibile in negozi selezionati e su hm.com dal 30 ottobre 2025.",Modi,n

"as of late i feel like reddit has become a bit of an environment where people cry about seeing red whenever orange man speaks, etc etc etc...

the reality is stocks will always dip and they will always go up... you're making educated gambling decisions here... i am not sure why people struggle to understand this... you shouldn't be investing if you don't have belief and certainty about your financial decisions.

read charts, keep up to date with the news, watch youtube videos and most importantly, make educated decisions for yourself - whether you are wanting to ride the storm or sell.

it really is as simple as that...

i speculated based on news reports before the previous friday that trump was likely to make a statement in regards to china and put half of my investment in a cash isa when it was at the peak... while the markets stabilise in this very minor dip, i may just keep it that way and continue with my regular monthly pay-ins... i feel it’s better to trim the fat rather than cash out entirely...

the key thing i’ve learnt in my few years of trading is determination, patience, and compounding. the rest will eventually average itself out... there’s no need to panic in the short term if your intention is long-term holding... otherwise, this is not the platform for you.

i love reading stories about people being positive about their experiences with trading and i just find it so funny how people vent on here the minute they see a 2% drop going in the red...

"U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports have generated over $233 billion in revenue since 2018, funds directed to farmer aid and deficit reduction.  
  
Targeted duties on steel, aluminum, and tech goods currently hit select categories at 25% to 100%, sparing most consumer items.  
  
The proposed 100% add-on would layer atop existing rates, potentially covering all Chinese exports and prompting supply chain shifts.  
  
Reportedly, China's export curbs on rare earths and software have accelerated U.S. responses, with officials citing national security in briefings.  
  
Trump's team views the escalation as leverage for fairer terms, including reduced subsidies and market access, per internal memos leaked to outlets.  
  
Critics from business groups warn of inflation risks, estimating a 0.5% to 1% rise in household costs if fully enacted.  
  
Bilateral talks have intensified, with envoys meeting in Geneva last week, sources say a framework could emerge by mid-November.  
  
The strategy echoes 2019 tactics that yielded Phase One, where China pledged $200 billion in U.S. purchases, though shortfalls persist.

My Fold 7 arrives tomorrow, I'm really stoked, but as of now, I'm caseless, which worries me. I tried local case stores, but they have nothing for the fold 7. I tried ordering a Benks Aurora Armor Air case as that was recommended by most, both here and on youtube, however it will only arrive next week and I just realized it comes without the front cover. 

I'm really not comfortable using a case without a front cover, so I searched for the Grand Combo deal online and you can get it for a reasonable price on Benks' own website, however this will most likely ship from China and I'm worried I'll have to pay duties and VAT as well as customs clearance and handling fees on top. Anyone ordering from Benks' website in the EU, did you have to pay additional fees and fill out a customs form? How long does it take to get here? Is it better to order it from a site like aliexpress?

Any case (front included) that you would recommend over benks' offering?

Am I right in assuming, that having just a back case makes no sense?

"I'm a nut for ancient history, but lately I reckon that a huge blind spot for me is Ancient China, roughly the Xia to Qin dynasties. After learning about just how intricate and advanced Qin bureaucracy was I've been hankering to learn more about it, what came before and the archaeology behind it.

However, as I'll sadly only see very little on archaeology outside of Europe and Western Asia at my university so I'm not quite sure where to start in terms of books. I already own The Human Past 5th edition which covers it very briefly, but I'm eager to dive deeper into Ancient China's history and archaeology.

So I was wondering whether anyone here could give me some recommendations?

Yeah it's safe to say that Stella Sora had a disastrous day 1 and flopped quite hard in both China and Japan.

I’m more of an introvert—calm, sincere, and thoughtful. I enjoy meaningful conversations, spending quiet time with God, and living with purpose. One day, I hope to raise a family that loves the Lord and follows His Word.

I’m looking for a genuine, God-fearing woman who has a personal relationship with JESUS and believes He is the Savior. Someone who values faith, kindness, and wants to build a CHRIST-centered home together . 

If you’re someone who loves God and desires to walk this journey of faith and life as a team I’d love to get to know you better(Age preference  27-36 yr old ).",China,neutral

"Hi all, 

Have read a number of posts, but still not 100% clear if my planned itinerary of UK -> HK -> Tokyo -> Shanghai -> UK would qualify. Any input from people who have done similar or have helpful insight would be much appreciated.

A couple of additional details:

1. I’m a UK citizen and passport holder.
2. I have a return flight booking for Air China from UK to HK (via Beijing connection) and returning to UK from Shanghai. These two flights are on the same booking, I have a separate Air China flight booking for a one way flight to Shanghai from Tokyo.


I was under the impression I can qualify for the 240hr TWOV as I am entering China from Japan and going onwards to a third country (UK). However since I am a UK citizen and my journey originally starts in the UK, I’m seeing some articles online that say I won’t qualify for the transit as I am returning to my home country. However I am not travelling directly to China from the UK but via Japan… this is the point I want to clarify. 

Thanks",China,neutral
"Hi, I’m in my final year of uni. I’ve recently received a job offer from a SME company. The work is in the field I’m passionate about, and I’d get good exposure to different aspects of the industry. However, I’m concerned about how the lack of a well-known brand name might affect my ability to transition into a larger MNC within the same industry in the future.

For a bit more context its a tech role, est size in sg <40. Fast paced, with counterparts in China.
Salary is not as high as I would’ve liked but its still acceptable.

I want to eventually transition to a larger MNC in the same industry, but I’m worried that working for a smaller company might make this difficult due to the lack of a “big brand name.”

I’m curious if anyone here started their career at a smaller company and later successfully moved to a larger organization, especially for tech as i think hr are alot pickier. How did you navigate the transition, and do you think the lack of a big-name brand held you back in any way?

Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks in advance!

Today, it’s agreed upon that America is (for now) the sole superpower. Others (EU, China, India and, indeed, the heir of USSR) are not unimportant, but simply not as powerful as America.


However, the Cold War is considered to have had *both* USA and USSR as superpowers. Now, the USA won, but…were they equally powerful or not? Russia, today, *definitely* is not. But in what way *was* USSR as equal? Was Russian as important a language as English? The scientific discoveries seem to have been equal, and even military inventions.

Was there a 50/50 chance of either coming to dominate the global scene or was USSR doomed to failure from the start?",China,neutral
