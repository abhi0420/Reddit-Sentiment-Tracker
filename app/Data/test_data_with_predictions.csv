"Today, I hosted my first Couchsurfing guest, a foreign tourist. I took him to Chandni Chowk, Red Fort, and Jama Masjid and India Gate thinking he’d enjoy the experience. But instead of feeling happy, I felt embarrassed.

The streets were too crowded with poor management, and there was garbage everywhere—plastic bags, wrappers, and waste just flying around. The air was so polluted that my guest was having trouble breathing. He was literally feeling that there is something stucked in his throat. But I was completely fine. Not because the air was clean, but because I’m just used to it. And that made me realize something—we’ve all just accepted this.

I'm living in Delhi since my birth, but today, I saw it differently. It’s like I was looking at my own city through a tourist’s eyes for the first time. And honestly, it didn’t feel good.

"Hear me out. This might sound extreme, but I genuinely believe it’s time to consider abandoning Delhi. Here’s why: 1. Not the First Time: Abandoning a city isn’t unheard of. History shows us that many cities have been left behind for various reasons—wars, disasters, resource depletion. Delhi would just be the biggest one. (Attaching a list of abandoned cities below for context.) 2. Distribution: I get it, this isn’t a perfect solution. But relocating Delhi’s population across smaller cities could help reduce strain on resources and make a dent in urban pollution nationwide.",HOT TAKE : Delhi Should be Abandoned.,Delhi,Negative,False,positive,False

"I flew into Geneva from the USA and spent my first day exploring Montreux and the Lavaux vineyards. The next morning, I took the GoldenPass Express to Spiez, spent a night there, and visited Lake Oeschinen the following day.

After that I headed to Lauterbrunnen, where I planned to stay for four nights. The weather wasn’t great—all day rain and dense fog—so I decided to move on to Zermatt for two nights.

From Zermatt, I went to Lucerne for two nights. I’d hoped to do some hikes but it was still rainy and foggy, so I spent my time walking around the city.

"Shubman Gill has taken the place of two of the Indian cricket greats at No.4 in place of Kohli and a captain in place of Rohit. It is very natural of their fans to hate Gill for it. Then there are Iyer, KL and Pant fans who are gonna spew as much hatred as possible because their favourite player didn't get what Gill got. Of course, the old Gill haters are gonna continue their work of spreading hatred on him.

England series will not be easy as the team is fairly new and there's absence of two great players Rohit and Kohli. It will be definitely challenging for Gill as a batter and a captain.

I pray that he performs and shuts the mouth of all his haters. This series is a make or break for Gill, I hope he succeeds.",Unreal hate for Gill,Shubman Gill,Positive,False,negative,False
